### Digital transformation within the public sector is at the heart of what GovTech, or Government Technology Agency of Singapore, does. We harness the best info-communications technologies to make a difference to the everyday lives of people in Singapore.

### **Vision**

Empowering our nation with possibilities through infocomm technology and related engineering technology.

### **Mission**

Engineering Digital Government, Making Lives Better. 

Today’s government digital services are held to the highest standards by users. Not only must they be safe, secure and accurate, they have to be easy to use and empowering. This means business is not as usual anymore for the government seeking to connect more closely with citizens.

This is a timely development, as the digital age is now under way. Digital technologies are acting as agents for change in everything from business to government, disrupting established industries and giving rise to new companies that dominate their fields.

### **Building a Smart Nation & Digital Government**

GovTech plays a vital role in materialising Singapore’s Smart Nation vision. With over 3,000 employees, we aspire to attract the best tech talent to contribute to Singapore’s digital government services. Our work can be broadly classified into three areas:
* Products
* Services
* Cybersecurity & Governance

**Products**

* We have over 700 in-house developers who develop products for citizens, businesses and the whole of government (WOG) and spearhead [Strategic National Projects](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/initiatives/strategic-national-projects){:target="_blank"}.
* We also have capability centres in Digital Services, Sensors & IoT, Data Science & AI, Cybersecurity, and ICT Infrastructure.
* GovTech’s Products team also manages the WOG digital infrastructure. This covers the migration to commercial cloud, management of data centres and the deployment of digital devices across the government.

**Services**

* The Services group is the biggest of the three, making up more than half of GovTech’s manpower.
* The Services group plays a key role in managing technology across over 60% of Singapore’s government agencies.

**Cybersecurity & Governance**

* GovTech is the sector lead for cybersecurity in the Singapore government. This means that the Chief Information Security Officer of the Singapore government is housed by GovTech.
* To ensure the safety and security of government digital structures, our Governance group sets WOG ICT policies and guidelines.

We believe infocomm technologies are powerful catalysts for change. This speed of change will accelerate through innovations such as Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and Big Data in the years ahead.

Ultimately, we seek to improve the lives of citizens and promote innovative collaborations among enterprises. We want stronger communities and a more responsive public service. What we have is a clear focus – to create and deliver a citizen-centric user experience that makes things easier.

### **Co-creating a Technology-Enabled Future**

Today, technology is no longer an enabler but a disruptor of business models. It can improve lives in a way unimaginable previously.

* At home, smart monitoring systems help the elderly live more independent lives. Dialect-speaking apps speak the language of many seniors in Singapore, reaching out in a familiar, friendly voice.
* An SME owner can benefit from automated licensing from ACRA. Smart forms incrementally ask him for the right information. A National Trade Platform helps him with the import and financing of products.
* For a young family, a digitised school transport system helps make travel more efficient. Student learning spaces enable children to learn online, at their pace. Automated transport pods make it easier to get around at smart HDB precincts.
* Services in future will be event-driven. They anticipate users’ needs and deliver what’s needed, even before they have to ask for it. They will enhance the convenience of everyday processes, making for a seamless experience with the Government.

Citizens would not be passive consumers of technology. They will participate and co-create with the Government, determining the services they wish to have. As increasingly active stakeholders, they will shape the country.
