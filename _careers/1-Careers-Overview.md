### **Overview**

We use technology to improve the lives of everyday Singaporeans – tackling real-world problems of transport, housing, security, healthcare, and the environment. We are working hard every day to design and build solutions that will make a difference to the citizens and businesses. It thrills us to know that our work can impact lives. 

We need people who share the same excitement and passion – individuals who are excited about building the Government Tech Stack, and developing meaningful products, platforms, and solutions for the public good. 

Agile. Bold. Collaborative. We are growing in ways we may never have predicted. We are challenging ourselves to innovate. We are seeking collaborators to co-create. Join us, and help build the next impactful solution for our citizens and businesses.
