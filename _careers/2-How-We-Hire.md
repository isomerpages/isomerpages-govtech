### **Hiring Right**

Our recipe for success at GovTech is hiring RIGHT! We need people who share the same excitement and passion – individuals who are excited about building the Government Tech Stack, and developing meaningful products, platforms, and solutions for the public good. 

We win by keeping our hiring bar high. By hiring the best people, we can scale up our Smart Nation initiatives and drive public sector digital transformation as fast as we can. We are seeking talented individuals to build our capabilities in application development, data science & artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, digital infrastructure, and sensors & IoT.

Because hiring well is important at GovTech, we want you to understand the nuts and bolts of our hiring process, so that you are prepared in your career journey. We don’t make the mistake of missing out hiring that great person.
