### **What is VICA?**

VICA (Virtual Intelligent Chat Assistant) is GovTech's next-generation Virtual Assistant platform. It leverages natural language processing engines, machine learning and artificial intelligence to learn and understand conversations to improve virtual and phone interactions citizens and businesses have with the Singapore government agencies. 
 
VICA is engine-agnostic and will be able to leverage the latest NLP technology to achieve better performance and accuracy.

Chatbots on the Energy Market Authority website (Ask Emma), Gov.sg’s website and Covid-19 Whatsapp channel are powered by VICA. VICA will eventually replace GovTech’s [“Ask Jamie” government agency chatbots](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/ask-jamie).
