### **Singpass**

![Singpass Logo](/images/programmes/products-and-services/singpass-logo-new.png)

[Singpass](https://www.singpass.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} is every Singapore resident’s trusted digital identity for easy and secure access to over 1,400 government and private sector services online and in person. Users can log in to digital services, prove their identity over counters, digitally sign documents and do more with the improved Singpass. Singpass is managed by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and is one of six strategic national projects that drive Singapore’s Smart Nation vision.

**Fast and convenient ways to prove who you are**

Users can log in to digital services easily and securely through various ways:

1. Using the Singpass app with their fingerprint, face or an easy-to-remember 6-digit passcode, without the need to enter passwords.

2. Entering their Singpass ID and password, followed by
<br> a) keying in a One-Time Password (OTP) sent via SMS, or
<br> b) a face scan enabled by Singpass Face Verification.

These Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) methods – Singpass app, SMS-OTP and Face Verification – provide an additional layer of security to better protect users’ personal data.

When transacting over selected counters, users can prove their identity using their Digital IC easily accessible in their Singpass app profile. They may also scan the Digital IC barcode at kiosks located in libraries and polyclinics. Other than scenarios where the physical NRIC or other identification cards are specifically required by law, agencies should accept the use of the Digital IC by the end of 2021.

**Singpass app: Seamless access to more services**

Since its launch in 2018, we have been progressively adding more useful features to the Singpass app for simpler everyday transactions. Current features include:

1. **One-tap access** to commonly-used government digital services like CPF, HDB, IRAS and NS Portal.

2. **Customisable profile** where users always have their important information such as CPF balance and HDB details on hand.

3. **Digital signing of documents** by scanning a QR code. This removes the need for users to be physically present to sign documents and agreements.

4. **Proving identity and providing information in person** by scanning a QR code. Currently, patients at SingHealth polyclinics and visitors to Republic Plaza can use their Singpass app for registration, in place of manual form filling.

5. **Timely notifications from government agencies** in the Singpass app inbox. For instance, users who are due for NRIC re-registration and passport renewal will receive notifications in their app inbox.

Of the 4 million residents on Singpass, more than 2.5 million users are on the Singpass app. For even more convenient sign-ups, the Face Verification service has been enabled in the app’s onboarding process. Users can set up their Singpass app with a face scan. This feature is handy for Singaporeans based overseas as they no longer need to wait for a physical PIN mailer or use their SMS-OTP to set up the Singpass app.

**Accessible for everyone**

Singpass is designed for everyone. To ensure that our services are accessible and inclusive, Singpass introduced more authentication methods like [Singpass Face Verification and Multi-User SMS 2FA](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/media-releases/2020-12-16-singpass-2fa){:target="_blank"} to meet the varied needs of Singpass users. The Singpass app is also built with accessibility features like dark mode and screen reader compatibility to help the visually impaired navigate the app with ease.

Besides actively improving Singpass services based on public feedback gathered through user testing and [Tech Kaki](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/tech-kaki-community){:target="_blank"} citizen engagement sessions, GovTech also works closely with the [Infocomm Media Development Authority’s Digital Readiness team](https://www.imda.gov.sg/for-community/digital-readiness){:target="_blank"} to educate users who may need more assistance using Singpass.

**Ever-improving security measures**

Singpass has stringent security measures to safeguard users’ personal data while ensuring Singpass services remain accessible to users. It is crucial for users to play an active role in protecting their account and personal information. Here are some tips to follow:

* Do not share your login information: 
<br> Keep your Singpass ID, password and 2FA details confidential.

* Do not reuse passwords: 
<br> Certain websites that you access may not be secure. Login information may be stolen from these sites and can be used to hack your Singpass account.

* Watch out for phishing sites: 
<br> These are sites that may look like government websites to trick you into disclosing your personal details. Always check that the URL is correct (www.singpass.gov.sg) with a ‘lock’ icon in the address bar.
