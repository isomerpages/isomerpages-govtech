[Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} is the Government's one-stop portal for publicly available datasets from various public agencies. 

Data.gov.sg goes beyond being a data repository. It aims to make government data relevant and understandable to the public, through the active use of data visualisations and data-driven articles. The key features of the portal are high-quality data presented via dashboards for quick reference, shareable charts and tables of datasets, and data blogs of social trends and government policies explained using data analysis and visualisations.

A new [sub-site](https://developers.data.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} for developers was launched in April 2016. With a single application program interface (API) key, developers and analysts can now access government open data APIs from different agencies via the portal instead of signing up with individual agencies.
