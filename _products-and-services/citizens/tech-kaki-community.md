#### We want to solve problems. In fact, we want to solve problems with you!

Tech Kaki is an end-user community established by GovTech in late 2016 to encourage citizen participation in the development of our digital products and services, ensuring that they are designed to meet the needs of citizens and businesses.

As a Tech Kaki member, you'll enjoy early access to government digital products and services before the official launch. In addition, you'll play a pivotal role in contributing your unique experiences to their development, making them even better. You'll work alongside our product teams in surveys, focus group discussions, user testing sessions, and stay connected with like-minded folks. 

Join our Tech Kaki community and become part of the team that improves our products for citizens and businesses today!
