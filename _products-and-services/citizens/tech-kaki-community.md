We want to solve problems. In fact, we want to solve problems with you!

At GovTech Singapore, we transform the delivery of Government digital services by taking an "outside-in" view, and put users first for our work.

Tech Kaki is a community set up by GovTech for citizen participation. As part of this community, you will get first dibs on new tech products before they go live and be part of the development team to make them better.

We regularly publish quick polls and mini surveys, and the latest in tech news. Join our community at [https://www.facebook.com/TechKaki](https://www.facebook.com/TechKaki){:target="_blank"} today!
