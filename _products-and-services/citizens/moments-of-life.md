![Moments of Life is now LifeSG](/images/technews/lifesg-banner.png)

LifeSG (formerly Moments of Life) is one of the Strategic National Projects under Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative. Aimed at providing a suite of services to support citizens’ needs at key junctures by integrating and bundling services across government agencies. It was first made available as a mobile application in June 2018 to support families with young children below six years old. 

Since then, the app has progressively added new features to serve citizens in other aspects of their life journey. These include an Active Ageing module for seniors aged 60 and above (rolled out in September 2019) and more recently, an Employment Support Guide for job-seekers (rolled out in June 2020). To date, the app has had more than 165,000 downloads. 

LifeSG offers users more ready access to digital government services through the consolidation of personalised content. The app will include a new user interface with improved navigation, topical guides and the following features.

 - Explore Services – Citizens can explore and easily access more than 40 Government services (up from 12 services previously featured on the app). Information displayed is grouped according to topics of interest, such as family and parenting, work and employment, healthcare, housing and property, and other frequently-used digital services. More services will be added progressively. The full list of services available on LifeSG can be found in Annex C.

 - Personalised Dashboard – Citizens can use the dashboard to discover recommended content, access guides that simplify processes such as job & preschool searches and discover government benefits through features such as the Family Support Calculator. 
 
Upcoming plans will include an improved dashboard to provide citizens with an overview of key personal information such as their CPF, housing, and education details. The app will also include upcoming medical and school appointments, and reminders that prompt users to complete important applications such as birth registration, baby bonus and primary school registration.
