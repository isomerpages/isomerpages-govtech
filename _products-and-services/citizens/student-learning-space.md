Launched in May 2018, the [Singapore Student Learning Space](https://www.schoolbag.sg/story/singapore-student-learning-space) (SLS) – developed by Ministry of Education and GovTech - is a student-centric learning platform that enhances existing teaching and learning in schools.
 
With a curated library of educational resources, the SLS empowers students to learn flexibly at their own pace, according to their needs and interests. Students are encouraged to take greater ownership of their assignments, work closely with their peers, and be self-directed, responsible learners.
 
The SLS is primarily for students, but has an array of benefits for teachers as well. Educators can use the collaborative features on the SLS as a basis for their own classes, and share tips on best practices and delivery methods with each other.
 
The SLS won the 2018 IDC Smart City Asia Pacific Award in the Education category, and has been successfully deployed in all schools across Singapore to date.

**Please note that there are also different SLS links for each school.*
