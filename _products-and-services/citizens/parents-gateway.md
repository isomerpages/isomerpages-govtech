Jointly developed by the Ministry of Education and GovTech, [Parents Gateway](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/) is a one-stop mobile app that strengthens the partnership between schools and families.
 
Launched in January 2019, Parents Gateway acts as a channel for convenient two-way communication between schools and parents.  Schools can use the app to send parents general announcements or updates on upcoming programmes, while parents can keep track of and provide consent for activities. Parents can now be more closely (and digitally) involved in their childrenâ€™s education. Teachers can conveniently create, send, and track notices or consent forms, and instantly collate results on Parents Gateway.
