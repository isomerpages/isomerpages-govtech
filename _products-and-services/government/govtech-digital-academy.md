GovTech Digital Academy  (DA) is a “Practitioner for Practitioner” academy that operates at the unique intersection of technology and public service, blending best-in-class technical training with the business of Government. 

DA grooms future-ready digital leaders and officers to accelerate public sector’s digital transformation to support the Smart Nation initiative. Through our [Digital Government Blueprint](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-government-blueprint/), we aspire to create a Digital Government with a digitally confident public service workforce that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart” to enable a Digital Society and Digital Economy. 

A digital public service workforce, one that continually upskills, is able to adapt to new challenges and build services that work more effectively across agencies, citizens and businesses.

### **The Challenge of Upskilling:**

The public sector’s basic courses on digital technologies do not meet the advanced needs of public sector ICT&SS professionals and the higher-level ICT programmes offered by private training providers are not contextualised for the public sector’s needs and goals.

That’s where DA comes in.

### **GovTech Digital Academy’s Ecosystem:**

Based on a “practitioner-for-practitioner” philosophy, DA’s suite of ICT&SS programmes are curated and developed by GovTech practice leaders and industry leaders – by practitioners, for practitioners.

These practitioners bring to our programmes the following insights:
* the capabilities agencies need for digital transformation
* the competencies public officers need for digital innovation and career growth

### **GovTech Digital Academy’s Offerings:**

Whatever your role in the public sector, you can choose practical and highly relevant ICT&SS programmes to grow your ICT expertise. You can:
* get up to speed with the latest tech trends and developments
* gain perspectives unique to the public sector’s digital transformation
* apply your new knowledge and skills readily to your daily work
* raise your proficiency levels
* make a deeper impact on your agency’s digital innovation
