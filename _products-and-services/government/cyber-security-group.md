**The Cyber Security Group (CSG)** is the cybersecurity lead for the Government sector with a mandate to protect the Singapore government’s ICT&SS (Smart Systems) and to build a trusted digital government for Singapore. To achieve these goals, CSG adopts a three-pronged approach: 1) develop cybersecurity capabilities; 2) collaborate with Whole-of-Government (WOG) agencies; and 3) forge industry partnerships.

**#1: CSG offers a full spectrum of Cybersecurity Capabilities to Secure WOG ICT Systems**

To support its various missions, CSG develops a holistic range of cybersecurity capabilities ranging from blue-teaming capabilities that detect and respond against cyber threats, to red-teaming capabilities that uncover cyber vulnerabilities in Government ICT and Smart Systems. Members of red and blue teams will often work together – forming the hybrid “purple team” – to leverage the combined offensive and defensive expertise to secure the Government’s ICT&SS.

**#2: CSG collaborates with WOG agencies to build a safer Smart Nation**

To maintain a strong security posture across WOG, CSG works closely with various government agencies to implement secure architecture. Working together with the Chief Information Security Officers in Government Agencies, CSG is able to provide cybersecurity governance and technical guidance to ensure that government agencies are aligned with WOG policies and standards and the right kind of security is built into our ICT&SS.

**#3: CSG forges partnerships with industry partners to augment government capabilities**

CSG also engages with the larger cybersecurity ecosystem to augment government capabilities. This includes collaborating with external partners to train cybersecurity specialists as well as conducting research and development for cyber projects.

CSG also works with members of the public through the Vulnerability Disclosure Programme and the Government Bug Bounty Programme to encourage responsible reporting of suspected vulnerabilities and weaknesses in government systems.
