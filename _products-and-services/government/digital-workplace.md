The Digital Workplace comprises a suite of productivity tools and digital enablers, designed to create a borderless, seamless and collaborative working environment for public officers.
 
One such digital enabler is [Form.sg](https://form.gov.sg/#!/). Spearheaded by GovTech, Form.sg is a platform for easy and responsive digital form building for public agencies.
 
Performing work tasks on-the-go is also easier now. Some of the upcoming smart workplace and individual productivity initiatives include Seamless Building Access that enables public officers from various agencies to gain seamless access to other government premises; and a smart AI-enabled meeting scheduler that automatically helps officers find common available time slots for meetings. Public officers can now also sync their Outlook calendars on their personal devices through CalSync, allowing them to view their work calendars when they are on the move.
 
Other implemented systems include resource booking, visitor management, assets management and workflow systems. A mobile app, specially designed for public officers, enables them to perform common corporate and employee functions such as room bookings, leave applications, and claim submissions.
 
Another recent addition to the list of functions is the digital business card, which saves officers the trouble of bringing around their paper cards.
