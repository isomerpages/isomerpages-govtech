The Networked Trade Platform (NTP) – developed by Singapore Customs and GovTech –  is a one-stop trade and logistics ecosystem which supports digitalisation efforts and connects players across the trade value chain – in Singapore and abroad. 

By bringing players across the trade value chain onto a single platform, the NTP enables end-to-end digital trade. Traders can tap on a range of trade-related value added services (VAS) such as cargo freight booking, trade financing, cargo insurance, customs declarations and payment reconciliation. These services will allow them to arrange shipments, improve cash flow, and better manage trade compliance, all on one platform. Trade is by nature cross-border, and the NTP serves as a key node for digital trade
connectivity to rest of the world. 

The NTP was the winner in the e-business category of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Prizes 2017, and was also conferred the best Smart City Project under the Economic Development category of the International Data Corporation’s (IDC) 2016 Smart City/Asia Pacific Awards (SCAPA).

Officially launched in 2018, the NTP is part of government’s efforts in driving industry-wide digital transformation.
