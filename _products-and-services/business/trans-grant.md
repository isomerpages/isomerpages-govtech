### **Introduction**
The Translational R&D Grant (TRANS Grant) initiative supports translation of R&D into applications and taps on the research community to solve public sector challenges with innovative use of digital technology.

This grant initiative is in support of Singapore's Smart Nation and Digital Government drive, and is jointly managed by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) and the National Research Foundation (NRF).

### **Eligibility and Evaluation Criteria**
Problem statements are gathered from government agencies and assessed if they meet qualifying criteria (i.e. no commercially-ready solution) for TRANS Grant application.

TRANS Grant applications are then evaluated based on: 

* Level of capability building, including technical and scientific merit of project
* Scale-up and commitment by agencies
* Alignment with whole-of-government / agency's digitalisation plan
* Potential industry application and value
* Cost and schedule

### **About the TRANS Labs**
A total of S$25m has been awarded to 3 TRANS Labs from A\*STAR, NTU and SMU. The capabilities\* of TRANS Labs include (but are not limited to) the following:
