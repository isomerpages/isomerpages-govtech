#### **Sensors and Internet of Things**

The Sensors & Internet of Things (SIOT) division, which was established as a capability centre, designs, builds, and implements a whole-of-government (WOG) IoT infrastructure that is built on the larger SG Tech Stack. This infrastructure enables connectivity by smart objects - including static and mobile ones (comprising wearables, sensors, mobile devices, etc) - and facilitates collection of data and management of a large-scale sensor deployments. We also build up the government’s capabilities in new, emerging technologies and collaborates with commercial organisations, research institutes and public agencies to experiment with and pilot new technologies to address their problems. 

Our work ranges from hardware design on embedded platforms and robotics, to infrastructure development and deployment on cloud management platforms. With these technologies, we apply them in WOG environments like the Smart Gym and Smart Office in order to help improve service delivery and meet the Digital Government Blueprint goals. We also collaborate with the industry, research entities, and agencies to build capabilities in IoT, pilot new sensor technologies, and solve IoT challenges.

Our engineers are involved in a wide variety of development work; all the way from low-level embedded design and programming, to managing and building IoT cloud infrastructure for the WOG. 

We also work closely with government agencies and industry partners to understand their pain points and develop solutions to actual use-cases.

Our engineers and solution architects are given a lot of flexibility and autonomy for them to exercise their full expertise and to take charge of the end-to-end engineering process. They are also provided with resources required to build, architect, and deploy products and digital services.

We have delivered meaningful projects that impact the nation, as well as innovated and prototyped SIOT solutions to meet needs of diverse groups of users; from elderly (with the IoT panic alert button), people with special needs (with assistive technologies such as the eCanvas), public officers to manage IoT deployments with ease (with SIOT’s DECADA IoT Platform),  to the general populace (with the TraceTogether Token for contact tracing).
