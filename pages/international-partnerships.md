Singapore realized very early on that we are not alone in Digital Government journey. Many countries are also going through the same struggles we went through and continue to go through. 
 
Singapore’s Government Technology Agency (GovTech)’s active engagements on the international front are key to advancing digital technologies for mutual growth and benefit, as well as promoting and advancing Singapore’s interests on Digital Government. 
 
We are keen to explore international collaboration opportunities on Digital Government projects and to share our experience.

For an overview of Singapore’s Digital Government journey, view a video interview series that is a collaboration between GovTech and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA). The videos feature Government Chief Digital Technology Officer, Chan Cheow Hoe sharing key learning points from Singapore’s Digital Government transfomation.

## Digital Government Exchange

At the forefront of our international engagement effort to promote best-practice development of digital technologies is the Digital Government Exchange (DGX).

DGX is an annual global gathering of Government Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and public sector leaders from digital governments and smart cities across the globe. These include Australia, , Canada, China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (UK) and the U.S.

Organised by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group since 2016, DGX is a one-of-its-kind international platform that has developed a community of like-minded leaders who can engage in information exchange, sharing of experiences, and mutual learning, while exploring future collaboration opportunities.

Representatives from multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, the World Economic Forum and the World Bank also attend these discussions.

## Partnerships

Our multi-prong international partnerships approaches include, inter alia, the following:

- **Bilateral:** Hosting foreign delegations keen to learn from our experiences.
- **Multilateral:**  Engagement of international organizations and governments, and participation in global forums for international cooperation on digital government (United Nations, World Bank, the European Union).
- **Non-Profit Organisations and Civil Societies:** Sharing Singapore’s digital transformation journey of the public sector at platforms such as World Economic Forum.
- **Knowledge sharing via the Singapore Government Development Portal:** The portal is a repository of detailed information of the products, solutions and guidelines we have developed over the years to support Digital Government transformation.

Singapore actively participates in platforms by giving keynote talks and conducting workshops. We are also active in private-sector led initiatives such as the Global Government Forum. We believe such engagements will serve a much larger community of countries looking to learn about Singapore’ journey, and sharing with one another in terms of digital development.

Through these engagements, we want to help, and learn from one another.
