There are countries that, like Singapore, are undergoing the Digital Government transformation journey. Some are going through a similar learning curve and share a similar experience with Singapore, while others are interested in learning from Singapore as an ongoing case study.

The Government Technology Agency (GovTech)’s active engagements on the international front are key to advancing digital technologies and best practices for mutual growth and benefit through Digital Government transformation.

We are keen to explore international collaboration opportunities on Digital Government projects, and to share our experience and exchange ideas.

For an overview of Singapore’s Digital Government journey, watch a special video collaboration between GovTech and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA). The four videos feature Government Chief Digital Technology Officer, Chan Cheow Hoe, sharing key learning points from Singapore’s Digital Government transformation.

## Digital Government Exchange

The Digital Government Exchange (DGX) is at the forefront of our international engagement efforts to promote the best-practice development of digital technologies.

DGX is an annual global gathering of Government Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and public sector leaders from digital governments and smart cities across the globe. These include Australia, , Canada, China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). 

Organised by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group since 2016, DGX is a one-of-its-kind international platform that has developed a community of like-minded leaders who can engage in information exchange, sharing of experiences, and mutual learning, while exploring future collaboration opportunities. 

Representatives from multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, the World Economic Forum and the World Bank also attend these discussions.

## Partnerships

Our multi-pronged international partnerships approaches include, inter alia, the following:

- **Bilateral:** Hosting foreign delegations keen to learn from our experiences.
- **Multilateral:**  Engagement of international organisations and governments, and participation in global forums for international cooperation on Digital Government by the United Nations, the World Bank and the European Union.
- **Non-Profit Organisations and Civil Societies:** Sharing Singapore’s digital transformation journey of the public sector at platforms such as the World Economic Forum.
- **Knowledge sharing via the Singapore Government Developer Portal:** The portal is a repository of detailed information of the products, solutions and guidelines we have developed over the years to support Digital Government transformation.

Singapore actively participates in platforms by giving keynote talks and conducting workshops. We believe such engagements will serve a much larger community of countries looking to learn about Singapore’s journey.

Through these engagements, we want to help, and learn from one another.
