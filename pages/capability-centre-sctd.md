#### **Smart City Technology**

The Smart City Technology (SCTD) division, established as a capability centre, designs, builds, and implements a government-wide Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to support a range of Smart City applications. Formerly known as Sensors & IoT (SIOT), this centre was renamed and reorganised in January 2023 to better reflect GovTech’s focus in putting together the technologies, capabilities, and products to enable Singapore’s Smart City vision.

Our work ranges from hardware design on embedded platforms and robotics, to infrastructure development and deployment on cloud management platforms. With these technologies, we apply them in projects like the Personal Alert Button and the Open Digital Platform to help improve service delivery and better meet the needs of citizens and businesses. We also collaborate with the industry, research entities, and agencies to build capabilities in IoT, pilot new sensor technologies, and solve IoT challenges.

We also work closely with government agencies and industry partners to understand their pain points and develop solutions to actual use-cases.

SCTD has delivered meaningful projects that serves the nation, as well as prototyped solutions to meet the needs of diverse groups of users:
* [Personal Alert Button](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/personal-alert-button/overview.html){:target="_blank"} for seniors living alone
*	Assistive technologies such as the [eCanvas](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/ecanvas/overview.html){:target="_blank"} for persons with disabilities
*	The [Open Digital Platform](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/building-an-operating-system-for-punggol-digital-district){:target="_blank"} for smart district management, starting with the Punggol Digital District

Our engineers and solution architects are given a lot of flexibility and autonomy for them to exercise their full expertise and to take charge of the end-to-end engineering process. They are also provided with resources required to build, architect, and deploy products and digital services.
