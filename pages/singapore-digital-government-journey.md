*Singapore’s digital government journey began in the 1980s with the National Computerisation Programme. Today, we envision a Smart Nation that leverages technology to improve the lives of citizens and business owners. GovTech spearheads the Government’s internal engineering and digital capabilities through synergy across the whole of government, as well as public-private and international collaborations.*

Singapore’s Digital Government initiative and public sector digital transformation are led by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech). Formed in 2016 with the focus of building and strengthening the Singapore government’s internal engineering and digital capabilities, GovTech has empowered the whole of government (WOG) to centrally design, develop, and deliver [digital services](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/){:target="_blank"} that are built for our citizens’ and businesses’ immediate needs. GovTech drives digital government transformation through these key [capability centres](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-government-transformation/#capability-centres){:target="_blank"} - Application Design, Development and Deployment, Cybersecurity, Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, Government ICT Infrastructure, and Smart City Technology.

## Digital Government Efforts

Our digital government efforts are aligned with the [Digital Government Blueprint (DGB)](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-government-blueprint/){:target="_blank"} - a statement of the Government’s ambition to better leverage data, harness new technologies, and drive broader efforts to build a digital economy and society. These efforts help support the larger Smart Nation vision, and can be classified into these few areas:
