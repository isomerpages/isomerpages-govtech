#### **Government ICT Infrastructure**

In GovTech, the Info-Communications Technology Infrastructure (ICT Infra) capability centre, also known as the Government Infrastructure Group (GIG), develops centralised ICT Infra for the whole-of-government (WOG). 

We are unique in developing ICT Infra at scale and as the foundational ICT layer that enables the entire government, impacting all government agencies and public officers. We specialise in architecting and developing agile, secure, resilient and cost-effective public sector ICT infra. Our diverse scope extends across data centres/hosting, networks, digital workplace applications, end user devices, IT support, secure ICT Infra, and ICT Infra applications – and to engineer it together and lead in optimising across performance-security-cost for the government. We tinker with new technologies to constantly improve the ICT experiences for public officers. We also provide reference architectures, standards and consultancy support to government agencies.
 
We develop government cloud and cloud-like solutions as the key foundation to enable greater agility and security for government agencies’ applications and services. 

To help public officers work seamlessly and securely in our flexible working environment, we rapidly ramped up VPN capacity   and are developing the next bound of government networks (e.g. SD-WAN (Software-defined Wide Area Network), Zero Trust Network). We delivered secure internet surfing for public officers to access the internet for work needs, overcoming the previous internet surfing separation. To enable an efficient workforce and future-ready workplace, we have also pushed for better and smarter office productivity and collaborative tools. 

On top of that, we provide consultancy support, with our valued deep expertise, to government agencies upgrading their ICT Infra.

There has never been a more exciting time to join GIG. Being in the thick of driving the WOG ICT Infra Transformation, we need deeply passionate people. As we lead in the engineering of ICT Infra infrastructure, we ultimately aim to enhance government agencies’ missions and outcomes. 

The 2 key roles we are hiring for:
* Infrastructure Engineer
* Infrastructure Architect
