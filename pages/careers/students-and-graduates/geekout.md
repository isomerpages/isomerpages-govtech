![GeekOut Collage](/images/careers/geekout_page_hero.jpg)

This fun-filled boot camp organised for current JC and Polytechnic students takes place in June, annually. You will be working in teams with GovTech mentors to solve a hackathon challenge over the course of four days.

This is a great opportunity to gain insights into various tech domains through workshops, forge connections with like-minded peers and GovTech’s leaders, and experience what it means to be Agile, Bold and Collaborative!
