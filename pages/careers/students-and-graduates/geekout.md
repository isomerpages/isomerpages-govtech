This fun-filled boot camp organized for current JC and Polytechnic students takes place in June, annually. You will be working in teams with GovTech mentors to solve a hackathon challenge over the course of five days.

This is a great opportunity to gain insights into various tech domains through workshops, forge connections with like-minded peers and GovTechâ€™s leaders, and experience what it means to be Agile, Bold and Collaborative!
