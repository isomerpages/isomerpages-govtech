### From delivering digital services to developing Singapore into a Smart Nation, GovTech advocates innovative technology to shape the way business is done in the government.

### **Leading Digital Transformation**

The world has become so fast paced that people don’t want to stand by reading a page of information, they would much rather look at a presentation and understand the message. It has come to a point where images and videos are used more to promote a product or service and this has extended from businesses to our daily routine. We are all in such a hurry that we wave bye instead of saying “goodbye”, show the watch to point to the time and so on. It is a healthy habit considering how we use our hands and motions to indicate what we are up to or capable of. The Government is in the process of crystallising the next phase of Strategic National Project, and will seek views and perspectives from different sources.

### **Capability Centres**

Our five capability centres were established to strengthen Public Sector engineering expertise and build the government’s capabilities in emerging technologies. Together, they will enable GovTech to develop and deliver innovative citizen-centric products and services across the whole-of-government, in collaboration with Ministries and Statutory Boards.

**Application Design, Development & Deployment**

This centre adopts an “outside-in” approach to deliver citizen-centric government digital services that support public sector digital transformation. Our in-house team utilises its deep technical expertise in design and software development methodologies - such as Agile, user experience design, quality engineering, DevOps and platform as a service - to deliver scalable, resilient, and reusable digital services which are supported by the Singapore Government Technology Stack.

**Cybersecurity**

As the cybersecurity lead for the Government sector, this centre develops a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity capabilities to support its missions. These range from blue-teaming capabilities that detect and respond against cyber threats to red-teaming capabilities that uncover cyber vulnerabilities in Government ICT and Smart systems. Beyond developing cyber-defence capabilities, this centre also works with various agencies to implement secure architectures and provide cybersecurity governance and technical guidance that help build a safer, more secure Smart Nation.

**Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**

This centre uses data science and artificial intelligence (AI) to extract data-driven insights and build smart platforms that help improve the delivery of citizen-centric services and ultimately support government policy outcomes. This centre also leads the charge in helping public agencies transform by empowering public officers to level up their data skills and working with agencies to support their data strategies and data infrastructure.

**Government ICT Infrastructure**

This centre develops a centralised Info-Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure, consisting of data centres, applications, devices, networks and other infra that is scaled across government agencies. The centre specialises in creating agile, secure, resilient and cost-effective infrastructure that is optimised for government operations and improves the user experience for public officers. Beyond this foundational ICT architecture, the centre also provides guidelines and support to government agencies.

**Sensors and Internet of Things**

This centre works on the design and implementation of a Whole-of-Government Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure that is built on the larger Smart Nation Platform. This infrastructure will enable connectivity by smart objects, including static and mobile ones such as wearables, sensors, mobile devices, and facilitate high speed transmission of data from the sensors. The centre will also build up the government’s capabilities in new, emerging technologies and collaborate with commercial organisations, research institutes and public agencies to experiment with and pilot new technologies to address their problems.
