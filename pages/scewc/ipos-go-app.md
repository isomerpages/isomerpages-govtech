The IPOS GO mobile app provides companies with the ability to apply for their trademark directly with the Government in just under 10 minutes, down from the previous wait of an hour! Businesses will save time and even costs from filing directly with the government.

The speed and convenience of filing will give businesses a good head start in differentiating their brand. This reduced time has boosted the number of trademark applications in Singapore by 30%.

The app taps on an important feature - A.I. With more trademark applications containing images, the feature helps to search for similar trademarks, preventing applicants from filing similar ones, enabling businesses to manage their brand better.
