Digital Service Standards (DSS) guide agencies to implement their digital services to meet the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) goal of delivering digital services that are easy, seamless and relevant for our citizens and businesses.

All public facing digital services of the Government must meet the DSS. In addition, the Government conducts mystery-shopping checks based on the DSS, to ensure that our digital services are implemented consistently to meet the desired outcomes in DGB.

A new version of the DSS has been released in July 2020.  The new version is available here:
