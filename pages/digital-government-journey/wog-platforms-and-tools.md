GovTech is the lead government agency driving Singapore's public sector digital transformation. Through our [Digital Government Blueprint](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-government-blueprint/){:target="_blank"}, we aspire to create a government that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart.” This means that transacting with the government will be easy, seamless, and secure. It also means that public officers will continually upskill and work collaboratively across agencies to drive digitalisation within the government and offer better services to citizens and businesses. 

The Singapore Government Tech Stack is an example of this as it provides all government agencies with a common suite of tools and services on a shared infrastructure to allow for faster application development and quality maintenance within the government.
