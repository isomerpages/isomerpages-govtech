Pre-booking allows citizens to enjoy greater convenience when utilising in-person services as it reduces unnecessary waiting times and allows citizens to better schedule their activities. When designing pre-booking services, it is critical that the needs of both citizens and service providers are met. On top of the end-user experience, services must be intuitive for service administrators and providers to promote adoption and ensure smooth service delivery. 

By optimising the experience of agencies and end users in GovTech’s pre-booking services, we ensure consistently high-quality service experiences for all users, in all contexts, regardless of their angle of interaction with the digital service. 

The importance of pre-booking services has also increased due to COVID-19 mandated crowd control policies and the need to allow service providers to conduct preparations such as sanitisation beforehand.

## BookingSG

BookingSG enables government agencies to offer pre-booking services to citizens, and this allows for locations to conduct preparations beforehand. It also enhances operational efficiency by providing a single touchpoint for agencies to design booking interfaces, have an overview of and manage booking requests directly, or assign global rules for automated management of requests.

BookingSG is well fitted for both its administrators and end users as it can be leveraged as a Calendaring, Availability, Rostering and Booking (CARB) management tool by agencies or as part of a user journey by citizens. It can also be used as an engine to serve highly complicated use cases by integrating BookingSG’s API to access its CARB logic.
