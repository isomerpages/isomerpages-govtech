### Environmental Sustainability at GovTech

*Our Journey to Net Zero*

In 2021, the Singapore Government unveiled the [Singapore Green Plan 2030](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}, an ambitious and rigorous strategy that outlines the country’s long-term plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 with the public sector leading the way. 

As the public sector’s centre of excellence for info-comm technology and smart systems (ICT&SS), we are taking the lead in decarbonising public sector technology in order to mitigate global warming and secure a smart and sustainable future for the people living in Singapore.

> “It is fortuitous that I was given this role to be the sustainability lead for GovTech, where together with my team, we drive the sustainability agenda as a convenor and orchestrator of all internal and external stakeholders and touchpoints of GovTech, as we build the foundation to move towards our 2045 Net Zero goal." - Liew Hui Ming, Director, Digitalisation Strategy & Partnership Office

### Sustainability Framework and Strategy at a Glance

![GovTech Sustainability Framework](/images/GovTech-Sustainability-Framework.jpg)

### Three Key Pillars

**Sustainable Organisation**
* We prioritise ethical practices and sustainable operations in every aspect of our operations, where we actively reduce, reuse, recycle and remove any unnecessary wastage.  

**Sustainable ICT&SS**
* We incorporate green practices and technologies into our hardware selection and software development approaches to provide more eco-conscious solutions.

**Digital Innovation for Sustainability**
* We empower the Singapore Government’s net zero journey with innovative digital solutions that make a positive impact on the environment.

### Our Enablers 

**People**
* Empowering all GovTech Leaders and GovTechies to drive eco-conscious practices across business lines, consuming fewer resources, and fostering a sustainable culture.  

**Process**
* Embedding sustainable standards, processes, and tools within the software development lifecycle to achieve sustainability by design while ensuring high service reliability and performance. 

**Partners**
* Engaging and collaborating with suppliers, industry peers, public officers, and citizens to drive the innovation and adoption of sustainable technology solutions and approaches.

### Key Initiatives 

**Digital Workplace**
* The [Digital Workplace](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/digital-workplace/) provides digital alternatives to physical transactions such as tele-conferencing and digital business cards.

**Government Hosting Consolidation and Cloud Migration**
* GovTech provides centralised energy-efficient data centres to support the consolidation of standalone server rooms and data centres.  We also develop secure [government cloud solutions](https://www.tech.gov.sg/capability-centre-gig) to accelerate adoption of modern cloud capabilities. 

**Green Software**
* We actively explore Green IT tools to augment our existing software development processes, and enable our product teams and engineers to manage and optimise their software to reduce carbon emissions. We are also a member of the Green Software Foundation. 

**Open Digital Platform**
* We are developing the [Open Digital Platform](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/building-an-operating-system-for-punggol-digital-district) to power smarter district planning at the Punggol Digital District. By leveraging ODP, district planners expect to progressively reduce energy and water consumption by as much as 30% compared to the national average.
