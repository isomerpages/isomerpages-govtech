We are committed to diversity and inclusion in all areas of our work with external and internal stakeholders. This includes empowering vulnerable communities through tech, designing inclusive interfaces and products, and creating an inclusive and diverse tech community within GovTech and beyond.

In 2021, the Women in (Gov)Tech Employee Resource Group (ERG) was established to develop ground-up programmes and initiatives to support the attraction, development, and retention of female talent within and outside of GovTech. This is in alignment with GovTechâ€™s commitment to the SG Women in Tech Corporate Pledge.

We believe that tech should be for everyone.
