## Combatting COVID-19 with Tech

In an increasingly digitalised world where there is an influx of information online, it is vital for governments to provide a reliable and accurate source of news and updates, particularly in a global crisis. The Covid-19 pandemic uncovered new and pressing demands for digital government services to provide timely assistance and solutions to cope with the outbreak.

To develop and scale digital solutions quickly, GovTech leveraged on its robust digital infrastructure and strong engineering capabilities to meet citizen and business needs. National portals and initiatives were successfully implemented, with 8.7 million visits to a contact tracing token collection website (TokenGoWhere) since Sep 2020, and 3.5 million visitors to a Covid-19 support grants platform (SupportGoWhere) since Apr 2020.

**GoWhere Suite**

The GoWhere Suite is a one-stop national resource hub for citizens to access all official COVID-19 related information and government guides efficiently and quickly. With inclusivity in mind, it is available in Singapore’s four official languages – English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil. The GoWhere Suite consists of numerous portals that are categorised according to citizen needs: daily updates, staying home, heading outdoors, health, employment and business-related matters.

**Video Analytics System (VAS)**

Our whole-of-government Video Analytics System (VAS) features scalable video sharing platform leveraging cloud services, on-demand Video Analytics (VA) as a Service and VA enablement that allows you to train your own VA models.

VAS is one of the key technologies behind Safe Distance @ Parks, the national website and app that shows users near real-time crowd sizes for parks across Singapore. This is achieved by relaying image snapshots captured by CCTV cameras in parks, at regular intervals, to VAS. The technology proves to be useful for citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic as citizens can access real-time information on visitor crowdedness online without needing to physically visiting the NParks to gauge visitor levels. VAS not only helps citizens to make informed decisions before visiting parks or specific areas within big parks to avoid crowded areas, but also allows officers to be more efficiently deployed for safe distancing measures. New features are being added to VAS and more use cases with government agencies could be expected in future.
