GovTech’s Data Science and AI Division facilitates whole of government adoption of data science and AI to deliver citizen-centric government services.

GovTech’s Data Science and AI Division (DSAID) was established as a capability centre to formulate effective policies and deliver citizen-centric government services through data-driven insights and decision-making. DSAID utilizes data science and AI when collaborating with government agencies to build in-house data science expertise, develop data strategies, deploy AI and data services, and set up data infrastructures across the government. 

This has improved Singapore’s digital government policy outcomes, service delivery and operational efficiency.
