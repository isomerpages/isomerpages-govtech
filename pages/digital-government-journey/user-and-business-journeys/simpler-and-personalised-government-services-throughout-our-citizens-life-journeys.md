As online transactions become increasingly common, it is crucial that governments support citizens by designing digital services that are easy to access and navigate. Putting citizens’ needs first can build public trust and yield positive outcomes for both the public sector and citizens.

Our goal is to deliver a seamless digital experience when accessing government services, such as those relating to citizens’ major life events, even when different agencies are involved. As part of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative, GovTech’s LifeSG smartphone app grants citizens simpler access to over 70 life journey services from various government agencies on just one app. The app has more than 330,000 downloads since its inception in 2018.

Through the app, users can apply for government assistance schemes, benefits, events and more. For intuitive use and a personalised experience, government services are grouped according to major life milestones and relevant events. These include birth registration and applying for the baby bonus (family and parenting), buying an HDB flat (housing and property), signing up for skills upgrading (career and employment), and finding out how to manage healthcare costs in Singapore.

GovTech strives to improve the LifeSG app by progressively adding new features based on user feedback and testing to meet evolving citizen needs. Examples include an Active Ageing module for seniors and an Employment Support Guide for job seekers that were rolled out during the Covid-19 pandemic. Given the multitude of government digital services and content on LifeSG, a personalised dashboard has been set up to enable citizens to easily discover relevant and recommended services, as well as the latest government schemes.

The app has also demonstrated its vast one-stop functionalities by being the platform for the nation-wide offering of the SingaporeRediscovers tourism vouchers, an initiative aimed at revitalising Singapore’s economy in late 2020. Since the release of the vouchers on the app, more than 140,000 users have used it to view their vouchers.
