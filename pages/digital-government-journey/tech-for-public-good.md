To cultivate a Digital Government that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart,” GovTech has developed technologies that are not only tailored to the needs of our citizens and businesses but empower them to achieve a greater quality of life. 

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, digital infrastructures and technologies were enhanced and developed to contain the spread of the virus, support public health facilities, and disseminate public communications and resources to citizens and businesses. This enabled Singapore to combat COVID-19 through a coordinated technology-focused approach. 

By driving a whole of government (WOG) digital transformation strategy and engaging in public-private collaborations to co-create a technology enabled-future, GovTech uses technology to be a catalyst for public good, community development and change.
