GovTech is keen to learn from other countries’ Digital Government journeys and exchange ideas on how we can improve from each other’s experience.

We are excited to explore international collaboration opportunities for Digital Government projects and to share our experience. 

## Digital Government Exchange

GovTech hosts the [Digital Government Exchange (DGX)](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/corporate-publications/digital-government-exchange-reports){:target="_blank"}, an annual global gathering of Government Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and public sector leaders from digital governments and smart cities across the globe. These include Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (UK) and the U.S. 

Organised by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group since 2016, DGX is a one-of-its-kind international platform that has developed a community of like-minded leaders who can engage in information exchange, sharing of experiences, and mutual learning, while exploring future collaboration opportunities. 

Representatives from multilateral institutions such as the United Nations (UN), the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the World Bank also attend these discussions.
