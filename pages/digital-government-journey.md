### Singapore’s Digital Government Journey 

Singapore’s digital government journey started over thirty years ago, with the National Computerisation Programme in the 1980s. Today, we have established a digital government that is ‘digital to the core, and serves with heart.’ This has resulted in a Smart Nation that leverages technology to improve the lives of our citizens and businesses.

### Overview 

Singapore's Smart Nation initiative and public sector digital transformation is led by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore, GovTech. Formed with the focus of building the Singapore government’s internal engineering and digital capabilities, GovTech has empowered the whole of government (WOG) to centrally design, develop and deliver digital services that are built for our citizens’ and businesses’ immediate needs. 

This includes the development of Infocomm Technology and Smart Systems (ICT & SS) such as Application Design, Development and Deployment, Cybersecurity, Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, Government ICT Infrastructure and Sensors & Internet of Things. In order to spearhead digital transformation in the public sector, GovTech also oversees key government ICT infrastructure, regulations of ICT procurement, data protection and security in the public sector.  

In summary, our work can be broadly classified into three main areas – Products, Services, Cyber and Governance. And is aligned to the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) - a statement of the Government’s ambition to better leverage data, harness new technologies and drive broader efforts to build a digital economy and society, in support of a Smart Nation.

In 2019, five Capability Centres (CapCens) were further established in the fields of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, Application Design, Development and Deployment, Sensors and Internet of Things and Government Infrastructure and Cybersecurity. These five areas are integral to our Digital Government Blueprint and Smart Nation agenda. Through our CapCens, a dedicated team of technical specialists within the government who are both familiar with the government agenda and accessible across the WOG were cultivated, allowing faster and more efficient proofs-of-concept and technology deployments.

Through these efforts, GovTech continues to develop and deliver innovative citizen-centric products and services across the WOG, in collaboration with national Ministries and Statutory Boards. By embodying our vision of creating a government that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart,” we have created a Smart Nation in which transacting with our Digital Government is easy, seamless, and secure.

The IMD-SUTD Smart Cities Index (SCI) is jointly developed by the Singapore University of Technology and Design’s Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities (SUTD) and Switzerland’s Institute for Management Development (IMD). It is the first global Smart City survey that assesses citizens’ perception of structures and technology applications that are available to them. The 2020 survey evaluated 109 cities and captured the perception of 120 residents in each city.
