### **New Vulnerability Rewards Programme to test Resilience of Critical Government Systems**

The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) has launched a new Vulnerability Rewards Programme (VRP) to augment the existing Government Bug Bounty Programme (GBBP) and Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP). Together, the three crowdsourced vulnerability discovery programmes¹ supplement GovTech’s suite of cybersecurity capabilities² to safeguard the Government’s Infocomm Technology and Smart Systems (ICT&SS).

The three crowdsourced vulnerability discovery programmes offer a blend of continuous reporting and seasonal in-depth testing capabilities that taps the larger community, in addition to routine penetration testing conducted by the Government. While members of the public can report suspected vulnerabilities on all Internet-facing systems through the VDP, the GBBP and VRP are only open to ‘white hat’ hackers – or ethical hackers – for testing due to the higher-value systems involved. The seasonal GBBP focuses on selected systems in each iteration, whereas the new VRP aims to continuously test a wider range of critical ICT systems necessary for the continuous delivery of essential services in our digital economy.

The VRP offers monetary rewards ranging from US$250 to US$5,000 to white hat hackers, depending on the severity of the vulnerabilities discovered. A special bounty of up to US$150,000 will be awarded for the discovery of vulnerabilities that could cause exceptional^[3] impact on selected systems and data. The special bounty is benchmarked against crowdsourced vulnerability programmes conducted by global technology firms such as Google and Microsoft . This signals the Singapore Government’s commitment to secure critical ICT systems and sensitive personal data.
