### Developing Future Leaders for the Technology, Media, and Information Sectors

**(A)	IMDA SG Digital Scholarship**

63 individuals received the SG Digital Scholarship, an industry scholarship, which focuses on developing future leaders for Singapore’s technology and media ecosystem. The IMDA invests in top talent at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The SG Digital scholars are given the flexibility to chart their own career with the industry and take on key roles in a tech or media-related field in an organisation of their choice in Singapore, contributing to Singapore’s digital future. As part of the scholarship, recipients will have access to internship, mentorship, and networking opportunities with IMDA’s industry partners, on top of funding support for tuition fees, courses and certifications beyond school curriculum, and overseas programmes, to equip them with necessary skills to thrive in the tech and media ecosystem.

Of the 63 SG Digital Scholarships awarded this year, 16 scholars will focus on developing capabilities in future communications, (e.g., 5G technologies and beyond). IMDA aims to jumpstart cutting-edge communications and connectivity research. This grows local capability to translate research into innovative products, services, and companies.

The SG Digital Scholars are part of a growing community of Singaporean digital leaders for the tech and media ecosystem under IMDA’s SG Digital Leadership Accelerator (SGLDA). Launched in August 2022, the SGDLA aims to fast-track leadership development of local tech and media talent in various stages of their career, who can drive Singapore's digital future.

**(B)	Smart Nation Scholarship**

12 recipients were awarded the Smart Nation Scholarship (SNS). The SNS seeks to develop future technology leaders who are passionate in making a difference to our national digital transformation. Jointly offered by the CSA, GovTech, and IMDA, scholars can look forward to a multifaceted career, specialising in a variety of tech domains and opportunities for job rotations across the different public agencies.

**(C)	MCI Information Service Scholarship**

6 recipients were awarded the MCI Information Service Scholarship. This scholarship was introduced in 2008 to attract young talents with an interest in government communications. Information Service scholars will play an important role in public communications to ensure that citizens are heard and connected to the government. This includes engaging citizens on national and social issues through various channels, strengthening whole-of-government communications preparedness, communicating policies to the public, and managing government media relations.

**(D)	MCI Postgraduate Scholarship**

2 recipients were awarded the MCI Postgraduate Scholarship. Beyond attracting and growing young talents, MCI also strives to develop in-service officers’ professional and specialised capabilities through this scholarship. This is awarded on a yearly basis to MCI officers to pursue postgraduate studies.

**(E)	NLB Scholarship**

2 recipients were awarded the NLB scholarship. This scholarship seeks to build and nurture a diverse talent pipeline in information literacy, knowledge creation and preservation in the development of Singapore’s libraries and archives of the future. These scholarship holders will play a key role in realising NLB’s goal of transforming the reading and learning experience for all Singaporeans, as envisioned through LAB25 (Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025) for building a Learning Marketplace, nurturing an Informed Citizenry, inspiring Singapore Storytellers, and being an Equaliser.
