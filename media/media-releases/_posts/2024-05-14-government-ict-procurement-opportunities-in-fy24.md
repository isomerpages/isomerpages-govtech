### Increased investment in modernisation of digital infrastructure

Over 60 per cent ($2.1 billion) of the Government’s projected FY24 ICT procurement opportunities will go towards enhancing its digital infrastructure, up from $1.3 billion in FY23. With the public increasingly relying on digital services to interact with the Government, strengthening the resilience of digital infrastructure is crucial for the Government to minimise disruptions and uphold public trust. Projected infrastructure investment has been on an upward trend since FY21, as the Government seeks to lay the foundation for deep digital transformation across the Public Service. 

Existing infrastructure must be re-engineered to reduce the complexities of ICT systems, modernise ageing systems, and bolster defences against evolving cybersecurity threats. 

The Government will continue to encourage the adoption of reusable development tools by the industry. In addition to reducing costs, such “build once, use often” tools – which include the Singapore Government Tech Stack and commercially available Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions – also streamline security compliance and promote interoperability. 

### Simplifying governance to uplift industry’s delivery quality

In response to industry feedback, the Government is trialling streamlined compliance and procurement frameworks to reduce friction and uplift delivery quality when working with the industry.

First, the Government is reviewing the stringent security requirements that apply to low-risk government systems. This helps vendors work in a more agile, cost-effective manner with the Government while ensuring that requirements for critical systems remain robust. More information for vendors is available on GovTech’s website, with the [page](https://go.gov.sg/tech-standards){:target="_blank"} to be updated regularly as the policy reform effort progresses. Tenders for which the streamlined requirements will be in effect include the Cybersecurity and Audit Services bulk tender, which involves the provision of cybersecurity risk assessments, testing, and audit services.

Second, perpetual and dynamic contracting will also be introduced for selected bulk tenders in FY24. Contracts under this new model will have no end date and allow for the flexible addition of new vendors to ensure the contracts remain competitive. This means that vendors who were previously awarded a bulk tender and continue to meet the Government’s requirements will not need to spend time and effort to re-apply when a contract expires.

Third, Tender Lite is a new tender category that removes the need for certain contract clauses such as security deposits for performance and is intended to improve businesses’ ease in transacting with the Government. It was rolled out for general goods and services contracts from $90,000 to one million in value earlier this year, and the Government is seeking feedback from industry on how best to do the same for ICT contracts.

### New event format to foster closer collaboration with industry

The format for GovTech’s annual industry event has changed this year to place greater emphasis on engagement with the industry. Renamed ‘Industry Engagement’ from ‘Industry Briefing’, this year’s event introduces five closed-door discussions with industry on a variety of topics. These include soliciting feedback on compliance and procurement regulations, and the Government’s wider digital government strategy. 

Mr Goh Wei Boon, Chief Executive, GovTech, said: “The dynamic nature of today’s technological and social landscape requires the Government to be more agile. Engaging our industry partners allows us to tap the complementary strengths of the public and private sectors, and I hope this close partnership will ensure a smooth journey together on the next bound of Smart Nation.”
