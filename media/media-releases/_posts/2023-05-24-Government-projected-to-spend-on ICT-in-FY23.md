## **Government projected to spend $3.3 billion on ICT in FY23**

SINGAPORE, 24 MAY 2023

 $1 billion for applications developed on the cloud
 Co-developed projects with industry will account for almost half (45 per cent) of projected spending, up from a third in FY22
 New bulk tenders to further aggregate demand for ICT services
 Sustainability criteria to be incorporated into evaluation process starting in 2H 2023

The Government will spend an estimated $3.3 billion on info-communications technology (ICT) this year 1 , building on past years’ investments to modernise its
digital infrastructure and develop better services for citizens, businesses, and public officers. In total, the Government has invested about $16 billion in ICT over the last five years.

### **More systems to be developed on Government Commercial Cloud**

More than 30 per cent ($1 billion) of the Government’s projected ICT spending for FY23 are for applications developed on the Government Commercial Cloud (GCC). Since the announcement of the “Cloud First” Strategy in October 2018, about 66 per cent of eligible government systems have been migrated to the Government Commercial Cloud (GCC), putting the goal of 70 per cent by end 2023 within reach.

### **More systems to be developed on Government Commercial Cloud**
The value of projects co-developed with industry is expected to increase to about 45 per cent ($1.49 billion) of total spending in FY23, up from 27 per cent and 20 per cent in FY22 and FY21 respectively.

<br>Co-developed projects 2 streamline development efforts by leveraging the SG Tech Stack and other government platforms for security compliance and interoperability, as well as reusing well-tested software components to build applications efficiently. There are currently 27 vendors qualified to co-develop projects with the Government using the SG Tech Stack. This list of vendors will be refreshed with the Agile Co-Development and ICT Professional Services bulk tender ($0.62 billion) to be called in FY23.

<br><sup>[1]</sup> Projected ICT spending was $3.8 billion in both FY22 and FY21. Past efforts to aggregate demand for ICT services through bulk tenders, and to modernise the Government’s backend ICT infrastructure through the cloud, have resulted in cost savings.
<br> 
<br><sup>[2]</sup> In co-developed projects, government engineers/developers may be responsible for building one component while their industry counterparts build another. This differs from the traditional outsourced model, where the project is built entirely by a vendor based on the requirements stipulated by the government agency.

### **More projects to be awarded through bulk tenders**

Almost 76 per cent ($2.5 billion) of the Government’s projected FY23 ICT spending will go to projects awarded through bulk tenders, up from 27 per cent in FY22. By aggregating demand for ICT products and services common across the Government, bulk tenders reduce costs, time, and effort for public agencies in procuring these services. The value of public agencies’ procurement through bulk tenders has been on an upward trend since 2018.

There are three key bulk tenders amounting to $1.85 billion to be called in FY23:

<br> **1** Enterprise Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) [$0.6 billion]: With greater
use of the cloud in the public service, agencies can access a range of
ready-made, subscription-based software over the Internet to meet
operational needs. This tender provides agencies with customer
relationship management (CRM), case management, and service
management software to meet their operational needs, as well as “low
code” platforms that minimise the coding required to create software
applications.

Hosting Support Services (HSS) [$0.85 billion]: This tender provides
agencies with a standardised set of core services to support cloud and
on-premises hosting.

Personal Computers &amp; Printer [$0.4 billion]: The devices used by public
officers are replaced approximately every three years. Over 100,000 3
devices are expected to be replaced under this bulk tender, which will
incorporate sustainability criteria for the first time.

Opportunities for Small &amp; Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remain plentiful. Nearly
80 per cent of all procurement opportunities for FY23 will be available to SMEs, the
same as last year.

### **Annex A**

**Government support for the F&B sector**

The Government provides support for the Food and Beverage (F&B) sector to enhance their core capabilities and improve productivity, such as through the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) and the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG).

The PSG helps Singapore companies improve their productivity and automate existing processes through IT solutions and equipment, while the EDG is for Singapore companies starting new projects to upgrade their business, explore new growth, or expand overseas. EDG funds qualifying project costs namely third-party consultancy fees, software and equipment, and internal manpower cost.

Over the years, many F&B businesses, including coffee shops, have tapped the PSG and EDG to adopt digital solutions and automated equipment, enabling them to reap economies of scale, improve efficiency and achieve manpower and cost savings. 

F&B businesses can also tap the Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG), introduced last year, to invest in energy-efficient equipment and reduce energy costs. The EEG aims to help businesses in the Food Services, Food Manufacturing and Retail sectors cope with rising energy costs through co-funding support to invest in energy-efficient equipment. It will provide up to 70% support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt pre-approved energy-efficient equipment including LED lighting, cooking hobs and refrigerators.
