### **Formal Declaration of the Memorandum of Understanding **

The United Kingdom and Singapore are pleased to announce the signing of a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that continues to build on the existing relationship between the UK and Singapore on the areas of digital government. The MoU will remain in effect for 3 years and supports the long-standing partnership between the two agencies and helps to strengthen collaboration in the design and delivery of digital government public services.

The signing of the MoU took place on 4 July 2022 at 10 Whitechapel High Street, London. Representing the agencies to sign the MoU were Mr. Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive of GovTech Singapore and Mr. Tom Read, Chief Executive Officer and Director General of Government Digital Service (GDS) UK.

**Providing digital government services**

Both the UK and Singapore are widely recognised as digital leaders and take an active role in shaping international standards and discussions in the digital government space.

The formalisation of both countriesâ€™ cooperation and collaboration is backed by their respective recognition of the importance of providing digital government services, and signals their intent to lock in the gains from the rapid digitalisation from the last three years. This MoU follows the signing of the [UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement (UKSDEA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-singapore-digital-economy-agreement-explainer/uk-singapore-digital-economy-agreement-final-agreement-explainer){:target="_blank"} that came into force on 14 June 2022.

In recent years, Singapore has invested heavily in Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT), taking a holistic digital society approach by investing in their digital infrastructure, developing private sector digital capability, and setting aspirational digital government agendas.

The MoU will cover not only sharing know-how and approaches to building digital services, but also exploring new ways of working that help build more effective, efficient and economical government digital services in the long term.

Continuing the digital government partnership
