> Mr Chan Cheow Hoe to join IDA

The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) will be appointing Mr Chan Cheow Hoe as the Government Chief Information Officer (CIO) /Assistant Chief Executive (Government Chief Information Office or GCIO) with effect from 1 April 2014.  

As the Government CIO, Mr Chan will oversee the Singapore Government’s central information technology systems and infrastructure and drive the development and delivery of innovative public services for citizens and businesses in partnership with ministries and agencies.  He will report to Ms Jacqueline Poh, the Managing Director of IDA.

Mr Chan has more than two decades of extensive experience in senior management positions overseeing organisation wide IT development and systems.  He also has a strong track record of leading IT professionals in global companies and large corporations to deliver efficient and effective IT systems and solutions. His expertise includes leading organisations through transformational change and connecting IT to the needs of the organisation. 

Mr Chan joins IDA from CT Corporation, one of the largest conglomerates in Indonesia with interests in financial services, retail, media, travel and entertainment, where he served as Group Chief of Information Technology and Systems.  Prior to CT Corporation, Mr Chan held senior positions in Citibank, Barclays, Ernst & Young, ABN-AMRO and DELL Computers. 

The current Assistant Chief Executive (GCIO), Mr James Kang, will be returning to the private sector.  Since joining IDA in 2008, Mr Kang has played a key role in the development of the Singapore e-Government Masterplan 2011-2015 (eGov2015) which aims to facilitate greater co-creation between the Government, people and private sectors to create value for Singapore. The revamped eCitizen portal, OneInbox, Government Cloud and the opening up of government data through data.gov.sg are some of the initiatives launched under the Masterplan. During his tenure, Mr Kang initiated the building of new core skills within the GCIO such as Agile development, user experience design and business analytics, thus boosting government capabilities and efficiency. All these initiatives have contributed to continued international recognition of Singapore as a leading e-Government in the world.

In his more than five years at the helm of the Government Chief Information Office, he has made considerable contributions to IT development within the Singapore Government, tapping on new technologies like cloud computing and business analytics to enhance our capabilities. 

“We look forward to welcoming Mr Chan Cheow Hoe into IDA.  His extensive experience in managing technology development in large and complex businesses will be valuable in IDA’s continued efforts to ensure operational resilience, transform the Government sector and uplift digital services in order to better serve our citizens.”
