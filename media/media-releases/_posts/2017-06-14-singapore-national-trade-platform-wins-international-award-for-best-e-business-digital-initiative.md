The National Trade Platform (NTP) project led by Singapore Customs and the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) has emerged the winner in the e-business category of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Prizes 2017 <sup>[1]</sup>

The WSIS Prizes recognise outstanding digital projects <sup>[2]</sup> worldwide which foster socio-economic development across categories such as e-government, e-environment, e-science and media. The winners of the 18 categories were announced on 13 Jun 2017 at the annual WSIS Forum held in Geneva, Switzerland.

This is the first time that a digital initiative from Singapore has won in any of the 18 categories of the WSIS Prizes since the inception of these prizes in 2012. The NTP beat four other projects to come up tops in the e-business category. Receiving the award for the NTP were Mr Ho Chee Pong, Director-General, Singapore Customs, and Mr Tan Eng Pheng, Senior Director (Clusters Group), GovTech.

Currently being developed, the NTP – which will replace the existing TradeNet® <sup>[3]</sup> and TradeXchange® systems – is a one-stop next-generation trade information management platform to support companies in the trade and logistics industry and adjacent sectors such as trade finance. The NTP will be progressively rolled out from end-2017.

The NTP will help businesses to streamline work processes, reduce inefficiencies of manual trade document exchange, and leverage data analytics for insights from their trade data, so as to be well-equipped for the digital economy.

In August 2016, the NTP was also conferred the best Smart City Project under the Economic Development category of the International Data Corporation’s (IDC) 2016 Smart City/Asia Pacific Awards (SCAPA).
