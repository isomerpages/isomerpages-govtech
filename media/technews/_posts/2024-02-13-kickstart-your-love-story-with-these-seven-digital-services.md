![6 apps for couples](/images/technews/vday-apps.png)

Valentine’s Day is just around the corner! 

That means it’s the season for expensive chocolates, flowers, and fully-booked restaurants. That’s all good, but as any married couple will tell you, making a love story go the distance will definitely take a lot more than that. 

Think effort, commitment, and lots of hard work. Thankfully, these days there are plenty of apps going around to make life a little easier for loved ones. 

With that in mind, our GovTech team has selected our top apps for couples this Valentine’s Day.

### 1. Get intellectually stimulated with the NLB mobile app

Ah, the library – one of the first places that young Singaporeans go on a date. It’s air-conditioned, has a large collection of books – and it's, of course, free. Here’s the thing: libraries have plenty to offer a relationship long after the honeymoon period. Nurture your relationship through shared interests with the National Library Board app. Borrow books and other audiovisual material that spark conversations, plan cultural dates, and attend events together. 

It's a unique way to bond and grow as a couple – remember, staying intellectually compatible is a big part of being romantically compatible! Download the app [here.](https://mobileapp.nlb.gov.sg/) 

PS: If you borrow ebooks, you don’t need to worry about returning them late. That’s one way to avoid arguing about fines! 


### 2. Never lose your way again with NParks NEAR 

Singapore has a huge range of public parks, thanks to NParks. That means plenty of green spaces for couples to unwind after a long week of work. Take a long stroll amongst nature as a couple, or hop on a bicycle and see the paths take you.  Singapore’s Park Connector Network (PNC) has 300 km of trails and there’s no better way to explore all of them via the NParks Explore A Route (NEAR) mobile app.

This augmented reality (AR)-enabled application (NParks) will enhance your couple experiences by overlaying interactive, informative content on the real-world environment. Learn and get entertained while being on the move! 

For those who’re afraid of getting lost (and partners losing their tempers), a key feature of NEAR is an interactive map, which enables users to navigate and explore the PCN and various trails. This includes detailed route information, points of interest, and distance markers, encouraging discovery and exploration.

Get NEAR with your partner [here!](https://near.nparks.gov.sg/about) 

### 3. Get your relationship moving with MyTransport

When it comes to love, showing up is important. But showing up on time is equally, if not more important; it's not good to keep your partner waiting in the sweltering Singapore heat. 

That’s where the MyTransport app comes in. [MyTransport](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/ltagov/Home/PDF/MTM.pdf) lets you check for real-time updates on public transport services: Check bus arrival timings, train schedules, and service disruptions to ensure smooth and efficient journeys.

Use it to minimise waiting times at the bus stop, and save some money instead of taking a taxi or a ride-hail. 
 

### 4. Keep fit together with ActiveSG

Feel like the relationship is getting a little stagnant? Maybe it's time to liven things up with an active lifestyle. Why? Engaging in physical activities together and having shared goals are a great way for couples to stay together. Here’s the thing: Fitness is a continuous project; and the work never ends. 

And that’s why you need to download ActiveSG. Stay in shape together with the many [ActiveSG](https://www.activesgcircle.gov.sg/) facilities across the island – at a fraction of what private gyms or operators charge! 
Stuff you can do together include classic favourites like badminton, swimming, or hitting the gym.  But there are also programmes that you can sign up for that feature more niche sports. Think archery or belly dancing, or even pickleball. 

Yes, pickleball (you read that correctly). 

(PS: You can also hold each other accountable to good fitness habits by downloading the LumiHealth app)

### 5. Prepare to settle down together with MyNiceHome

In Singapore, asking someone to buy a HDB together is the equivalent to a marriage proposal. That’s why you know things are getting serious when your partner tells you to check out [MyNiceHome.](https://www.mynicehome.gov.sg/) 

Whether you’re choosing to BTO, or buy a resale flat, you can find out information about grants, loans, or even renovation and decoration tips. This makes it a treasure trove for those getting their flat for the first time. (But also the second, or even third time)

Remember, buying a flat will probably be one of the largest financial commitments Singaporeans make in their lifetime, so it’s important for couples to get educated on this! 

### 6. Seal the deal with Our Marriage Journey

For couples planning to take their commitment to the next level, the [Our Marriage Journey](https://www.marriage.gov.sg/) portal is a game-changer. The new Registry of Marriages (ROM) portal simplifies the process of filing for marriage online via SingPass, making the journey to your big day a little less fuss-free.

On the portal, you can also get access to resources to help prepare for marriage. You can also verify marriage documents, or plan your solemnisation.

Additionally, Our Marriage Journey extends its services beyond just the administrative necessities. The portal is a comprehensive guide for all things related to marriage in Singapore, offering an array of tools and information to support couples in every step of their marriage journey. From the initial stages of understanding legal requirements to the joyous moments of planning your solemnisation ceremony, everything can be managed with ease and convenience. 

Getting married has never been easier! (Well, kinda, you still need to find a willing partner)
 
### 7. Go through life together with LifeSG
Got married? Trust us – you’re only halfway through on your romantic journey together. Things often get hectic during marriage, with plenty of chores and errands. This is especially true if you have children. 

Well, enter [LifeSG:](https://www.life.gov.sg/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=ACCSSAlwaysOn&gclid=Cj0KCQiAoKeuBhCoARIsAB4WxtcDQWzqOlUZkCWvmQ9MUs_CVq1JCOiUGtMGB0HCW-ELc8OR_Bc_qE8aAvVpEALw_wcB) your digital assistant for navigating life's milestones as a couple. This can be anything from getting your baby bonus, paying taxes, booking public facilities, as well as online video consults from HDB (including getting a CPF top up grant). 

There are also educational resources if you want to read up about some of married life's biggest (and most stressful) parts. These include getting financial support for pregnancy, employing a domestic helper, or registering your child for primary one.

### Happy Valentine’s Day from GovTech !
Whether you’re planning special dates or preparing for a lifelong commitment, these apps provide not just convenience but also enriching experiences for you and your loved one.

Happy Valentine’s Day from all of us at the GovTech team! Here's to love, shared experiences, and the love of technology.
