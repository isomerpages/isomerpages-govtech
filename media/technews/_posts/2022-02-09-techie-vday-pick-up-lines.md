What are your plans for this Valentine’s Day? If you’ve already got a date, good for you! If you’re rocking your singledom by having a nice day to yourself or with friends, all power to you too!

But if you’ve got your sights on someone that you’ll like to spend the day with but haven’t quite locked it down, read on. Especially if that someone happens to work in the tech industry!

![vday2022!](/images/technews/vday2022.jpg)Valentine's Day is just around the corner, get your pick-up lines ready!

We’ve got some pick-up lines specially geared towards techies that you might want to try out. Ok, hold on. Before you groan and walk away, hear us out. 

Yes, pick-up lines can be cheesy, but pick-up lines that are specific to an area or industry also demonstrate some level of understanding of the field. So you’re not just showing your wit, but also hinting that you have taken the effort to learn about the tech industry. That shows sincerity and sincerity goes a long way! 

Still with us? We’ve even helpfully organised our pick-up lines by tech roles so it’s easy for you to choose the right one! And special shout-out to the internet in general, including Reddit and other sites, for coming up with these lines. Nope, they’re not GovTech originals, we just put them together. 

## UX designer

**Drop this line:** “I’m very font of you because you’re just my type.”

Why it works:** UX designers make your user experience of an app or website delightful through thoughtful use of layout, tasteful colours and of course – font. But what most people think of as font (Arial, Comic Sans, Times New Roman) is actually known as typeface. Font refers to a particular weight, width, and style within that typeface (light, regular, bold). 

This esoteric piece of information will definitely get their attention and give you the opportunity to lament about how Microsoft Word has misinformed the population at large. 

**Bonus deal closer:** Find out what their favourite font (sorry, typeface) is before starting the conversation. 


## Data scientist
**Drop this line:** “You better not try to cross-validate because you sure are over-fit.”

Why it works: In data science, overfitting occurs when a predictive model performs very well on the data it's been trained on but not on data that it hasn’t been exposed to (hence, overfitting the training data). Cross validation detects this by withholding different segments of the training data and testing the model on those unseen parts to see if the prediction performance holds up. 

All that technical information just to make a pun on how fit your prospective date looks. They’ll love it! 

**Bonus deal closer:** Come prepared to have a semi-intellectual discussion on whether artificial intelligence will be the end of mankind. 

## Software engineer

**Drop this line:** “Did you lose a timestamp? Because I’m pretty sure it’s datetime.now().”

Why it works: datetime.now() is a simple function for the computer to return the current date and time. Admittedly the line might work better in writing than verbally, but the function is used pretty often by coders so they’ll still catch on pretty quick.  

**Bonus deal closer:** Start a conversation about what’s the world’s most important coding language. Python? Java? Nah, it’s Cobol. 


## Product manager

**Drop this line:** “Let’s take our date from ideation to development. If nothing else, it’ll be an epic story.”

Why it works: So many terms packed into this! Product management is all about guiding a team of software engineers and UX designers to make or improve a product. Typically, that starts from brainstorming ideas and culminates in developing the product. 

In product management, an epic is a big chunk of work with a well-defined aim (say, launch an online marketplace). Epics are made out of user stories written from an end user’s perspective (“as a user, I want to be able to sort my listings by price”). 

**Bonus deal closer:** What’s it like to be a non-technical person working in the tech industry? Product managers will probably have the most experiences to share about this. 

## Say it loud, say it proud

Maybe you’re still not completely convinced about these pick up lines. Well, they are only as good as the delivery, and the delivery is good only if you have confidence. 

So say it loud and say it proud because you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. And even if they don’t work, so what? You don’t live with regret at the very least. And there’s always falling back on rocking your singledom.
