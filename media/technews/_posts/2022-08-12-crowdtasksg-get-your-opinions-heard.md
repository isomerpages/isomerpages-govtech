Are you someone who always has opinions on the latest trending news and topics? Or, are you the type of diner who leaves an online review after visiting a restaurant? Do you often leave tips and recommendations on travel sites after an overseas trip? 

If you love benefitting and contributing to the wisdom of the crowd or sharing your views about government policies, then you’ll love CrowdTaskSG – a newly launched crowdsourcing web portal to tap the collective intelligence of Singaporeans.

## What’s CrowdTaskSG?

On CrowdTaskSG, you’ll find various opportunities to share your opinions and feedback with government agencies.

For instance:
* You can participate in different tasks such as surveys on topics related to government policies and national identity.
* You might even find tasks to test out prototype products, such as new government websites to give your feedback about areas of improvement.

The platform is a one-stop shop, consolidating tasks from the whole of government and allowing interested people to easily access them. 

All Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents aged 18 years and above are able to access the portal with their Singpass account.

## How can I benefit from this? 

Apart from having your opinions heard, the process itself is designed to be fun. 

We aim to be as entertaining as your favourite online games. You can earn virtual Coins when you complete tasks on CrowdTaskSG and exchange them for incentives in the real world – vouchers, for instance.

## It’s all about co-creation

Recognising that Singaporeans are ultimately the end-users of government services, the agencies have been involving the public early in the workflow of product or policy creation so that their input is taken into account from the start. Citizens are really co-creators!

The current landscape of crowdsourcing may be perceived as fragmented, making it difficult for Singaporeans to get an overview of all the opportunities out there while agencies have a hard time finding the right target participants. 

CrowdTaskSG solves the issues on both sides with all government crowdsourcing tasks on one site. 

Agencies can also make use of the targeted assignment feature to reach their target demographic. For example, they can easily screen for older volunteers if they want to test how user-friendly a product is for elderly users. 

The CrowdTaskSG team is also looking to include more variety of tasks, including polls and A/B testing, and is reaching out to the various agencies to hear how the platform can better support their crowdsourcing efforts. 

## You can be a contributor too

GovTech is all about improving the lives of everyone through technology. The fundamental mindset shift powering CrowdTaskSG is that Singaporeans are not just beneficiaries, but can be significant contributors as well. 

So, join us as we leverage citizens’ expertise to solve problems. Who knows, your input and insight might just end up being the killer feature of the government’s next digital product.
