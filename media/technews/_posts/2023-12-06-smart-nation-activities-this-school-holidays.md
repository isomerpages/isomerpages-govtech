![5 fun activities this school holidays.](/images/technews/holiday-activities.jpeg)

The school holidays are here, which means one thing: The kids are out!

While everyone loves some good old family time, no one can deny that things can get chaotic fast if you don’t channel the little ones’ energy properly. 

That said, not to worry – we’ve got some suggestions on places to go, and things to do with your kids during the school holidays.

### Explore the New PlayScape at the Science Centre 
[Newly opened](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-science-centre-exhibition-explains-emerging-technologies-through-play) in late May, [PlayScape](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/community/showcases/playscape/) is an ideal destination for parents seeking to enrich their children's knowledge through interactive experiences. With exhibits on AI, cybersecurity, and other key digital technologies, it provides hands-on learning that is both [engaging](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-science-centre-exhibition-explains-emerging-technologies-through-play) and educational.

Each zone at PlayScape offers a unique glimpse into the technologies that support Singapore's Smart Nation initiative. 

Children can learn through play, gaining insights into complex concepts like blockchain and geospatial technology in an accessible manner. The exhibition's focus on gamified interaction ensures that visitors understand and retain what they learn.

Some fun highlights that kids might enjoy are programming a robot to dance to their moves, training an AI computer to identify 3D-printed animals, and watching a robot solve a Rubik’s Cube puzzle. 

Location: 15 Science Centre Rd, Singapore 609081
Opening hours: Monday to Sunday, 10 am to 5 pm.


### Head down to the Smart Nation CityScape
If you’re not up for the journey to the Science Centre in Jurong, how about something more central? 

Step into the [Smart Nation CityScape](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/community/showcases/cityscape/), a part of the URA Centre's Singapore City Gallery. We think it’s a great opportunity for the younglings to witness – in very real terms – what tech can do to shape their environment. 

CityScape invites young explorers to delve into the 'Building a Better Home exhibit', where Augmented Reality (AR) breathes life into Singapore's skyline. 

Children can craft avatars in the 'Technology Within Your Reach' exhibit, reflecting their personalities and embark on a digital scavenger hunt for hidden messages within the exhibits.

Watch your child's avatar navigate through virtual streets in the 'Unlocking Invisible Benefits' exhibit, uncovering the silent workings of technology that make Singapore buzz. 

Finally, engage them with tales of transformation, showcasing Singapore’s dynamic changes over the years and inspire them with the tech ecosystem's role in our lives through the 'Working Together for Tomorrow' exhibit.


PS: After a day of discovery, why not continue the adventure with a family meal at Maxwell Centre or a leisurely walk through the historic Ann Siang Hill Park?

Location: 45 Maxwell Road, The URA Centre, Singapore 069118.
Opening Hours: Monday to Saturday, 9 am to 5 pm. 


### Explore the new and improved Smart Nation Builder 
Housed within a 12-metre-long truck, the Smart Nation Builder is a roving exhibition by GovTech that provides an immersive and engaging learning experience for visitors of all ages. 

At the "Explore and Learn" station, children can discover Smart Nation initiatives in three key areas: Community Services, Healthcare, and Education. They'll get to explore how technology is improving these sectors, fostering a deeper understanding of how digital advancements positively impact their everyday lives.

The "Kids Wall" station, as you probably guessed, is a must-visit for young children. It features an interactive collaborative game where kids can engage in various tasks, such as building and maintaining a truck. Kids can also experiment with prototypes of upcoming digital government initiatives and products at the “Trying It Out” station. 

Want to capture some memories as a keepsake? 

Check on the on-site photo booth to get a family photo printed for free! Additionally, points earned from completing different stations can be used to play the claw machine, offering a chance to win Smart Nation collectables. 

PS: Did we say there are also candy floss and popcorn machines?

### Learn how to code – for free! 

There are plenty of coding lessons out there, but here’s one that doesn’t break the bank – GovTech’s very own. 

On our YouTube channel you can find instructional videos where children can learn how to code. Don’t worry – these aren’t complex languages like Python or Java; instead, the lessons mostly use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a language that is child-friendly. 
The series is called [Learning From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpmxnWUCorlVClvjhlb1-apn8nDGEM9Y) (Haha, see what we did there?)

Happy holidays!
