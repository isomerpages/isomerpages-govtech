## Happy Father's Day in advance! (Or belated, depending on when you read this article.)
Parenthood brings its fair share of challenges and responsibilities. Fortunately, we live in an age where technology can lend a helping hand, especially in Singapore.

Just using your smartphone, you can gain access to a whole collection of apps that are here to make a father's life a little easier. And it’s not just about daddy duties, there are also apps that will help a dad recharge and have some fun!

The GovTech team (which includes some fathers) has picked out our favourite apps for your reference.

## 1. HealthHub
Part of being a dad is making sure everyone in the family is healthy. HealthHub, developed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), helps you do that effortlessly.

You can easily access health records, find nearby healthcare providers, and stay on top of vaccination schedules. Take charge of your family's well-being with ease and convenience.

With the time saved from admin, fathers can go ahead and do stuff that they want to to do, like playing their favourite sport or  just chilling out with a quiet coffee.

Say goodbye to those old-school health booklets!

## 2. MyTransport
Taking a taxi or ride-hailing services is convenient, but this convenience comes at a price!

With the help of the MyTransport app, you can plan your trip and save some money for the whole family.

MyTransport is your ultimate companion for real-time updates on public transport services: Check bus arrival timings, train schedules, and service disruptions to ensure smooth and efficient journeys.

That means no more guessing games at the bus stop, shorter waiting times, and hopefully less restlessness amongst the little ones.


## 3. LifeSG
Juggling multiple responsibilities as a dad can be challenging, but the LifeSG app is here to lend a helping hand.

This super-app offers a wide range of government services and information in one convenient platform.

The app provides frictionless and delightful access to digital government services – whether it's something as momentous as registering your child's birth or as routine as receiving your NS55 credits.

From healthcare and housing to education and e-services, you can easily access various resources to streamline your interactions with government agencies.

By spending less time on paperwork and processes, you get to spend more time creating memories with your loved ones.


## 4. ActiveSG
What's the saying again? A workout a day keeps the dad bod away. (Editor's note: It's never too late to work out. Ed has a dad bod, he should start.)

To get the most amount of meaningful time with your loved ones, you'll need to maintain a healthy lifestyle. For more strenuous tasks like chasing a 2 year old toddler, you will need to get that training in to get that stamina up. 

The ActiveSG app is your go-to fitness companion, offering a plethora of sports facilities, activity bookings, and fitness programs suitable for the whole family.

Whether it's swimming sessions, badminton matches, or energising fitness classes, you can keep your family active and engaged in a healthy lifestyle.

## 5. NParks
If working out in a gym is not for you, then why not take a walk in nature? That's where the NParks app comes in.

Explore Singapore's beautiful green spaces, parks, and nature reserves with your family. Discover hidden gems, plan outdoor adventures, and join guided walks to create lasting memories. From picnics in the park to wildlife spotting and serene nature trails, NParks has got you covered.

As much as we like all things tech, sometimes you need to unplug from the digital world and immerse yourselves in the beauty of nature.

So whether it is a solo adventure hike for dad, or a family day out in the sun, make sure you have the NParks app packed away.

## Happy Father's Day!
As Father's Day approaches, let's celebrate the incredible dads in Singapore and their unwavering dedication to their families.

These apps not only make fatherhood more manageable but also enhance the bond between fathers and their children.

By utilising technology and harnessing the power of these apps, fathers can streamline their daily routines, prioritise their family's health, and create lasting memories.

Happy Father's Day from all of us at GovTech!
