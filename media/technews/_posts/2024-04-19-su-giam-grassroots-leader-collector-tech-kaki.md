![Meet Su Giam: GrassRoots Leader, Collector and Tech Kaki](/images/technews/su-giam-technews.jpg)

In late 2016, GovTech set up [Tech Kaki](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/tech-kaki-community/){:target="_blank"}, a citizen community,​​ ​to encourage participation and collect user feedback in the development of government digital products and services (think LifeSG, Singpass, MyLegacy, etc).
 
Since its inception, Tech Kaki members have given us insights to uncover usability issues or user experience challenges that aren't always apparent to us. It also gives us the opportunity to validate some assumptions around specific user behaviours. Furthermore, by co-creating ​alongside our product teams and across the government in surveys, focus group discussions and user testing sessions, Tech Kaki plays an important role in fine-tuning our products to ensure they meet the needs of citizens and businesses, making their participation even more valuable.
 
Over the years, Tech Kaki has grown into a dedicated community of over 6,000 members from all walks of life. We spoke to one of Tech Kaki’s digital advocates, 62-year-old Jee Su Giam, to find out:

- What motivated him to join
- What he enjoys about being in the community
- What keeps him going

## What initially inspired you to join Tech Kaki?

The first time I knew about Tech Kaki was when I participated in [CrowdTaskSG surveys](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/crowdtasksg/){:target="_blank"}; it got me thinking about how I could play a larger role as a citizen contributor.
 
Later in December 2022, I was asked by a team from GovTech to help with usability ​​testing for [SupportGoWhere](https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}.

The test aimed to understand my first-hand experience with an upcoming feature to be launched, which was designed to assist citizens in understanding their eligible financial benefits. We had an hour's discussion about their website prototype, and I gave feedback on the website's usability and the feature's usefulness.

The experience, along with seeing GovTech's approach to developing technology from an 'outside-in' perspective, spurred me to finally become a part of Tech Kaki in March 2023.

## What makes you want to contribute to the community?

Joining the Tech Kaki community gives me a chance to share my interest in technology and ensures it meets the needs of end-users, especially seniors like me.

At the same time, I enjoy keeping up with the latest technology and app developments too! Recently, my volunteer work with the Smart Nation Builder in June 2023 allowed me to interact directly with the public and encourage seniors to provide feedback on apps like LifeSG and explore the use of AI for detecting early dementia via [Project Pensieve](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/initiatives/health/project-pensieve/){:target="_blank"}.

## What do you enjoy most about being part of the Tech Kaki community?

As a community member of Tech Kaki, I've enjoyed working together with the product and research teams to improve apps from a user's perspective and make them more user-friendly. 

Joining the Tech Kaki community also offers many benefits, like being able to share your skills and interests in co-creating technology for the public good. 

It's also a good opportunity to work on projects that make our society more inclusive, and I feel great that I can empower people through technology. 

You can make a real impact with your contributions and help seniors become more comfortable with digital technology, improving digital literacy across society. 

Through Tech Kaki, I've participated in various research and surveys, such as the Government Website Usability Survey and studies on the National Library Board Mobile App, LifeSG, and other government digital services.  

This has significantly improved my understanding of technology and how it can be applied to benefit Singapore. 

## Have you encountered any challenges while working on projects, and how did you overcome them?
 
In 2020, I helped start the “Senior Go Digital” program, where we faced challenges in teaching seniors to use new technology via digital ambassadors. 

The idea was to provide one-to-one guidance on how to use social media, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram, Zoom sessions, etc., as well as make e-payments via their smartphones, e.g., EPLJ (E-Payment Learning Journey).
 
Outside of the expected challenges of vision and hearing, I also noticed a significant language barrier! The majority of our presentation slides, pamphlets and posters were in English; most of the seniors were more familiar with Mandarin.

To overcome this, I took the initiative to translate these materials into Mandarin so that the seniors could better understand them.

During the usability test for SupportGoWhere, my prior knowledge of Government Technology (GT) was quite limited. However, this experience ignited a keen interest in understanding how I could actively contribute to shaping Singapore's digital landscape; thus, I joined Tech Kaki.

As a grassroots leader, my primary concern has always been the welfare of the residents I serve. I believe in the importance of ensuring their representation in the development of digital products so that no one within the community is left behind. This sense of responsibility and purpose is what drives me to continue contributing. Whether it's making a significant impact or simply playing a small part, the knowledge that I am making a positive difference is my most fulfilling reward.
 
## What are some of your hobbies outside of Tech Kaki? 

I am involved in various volunteering and community activities, including being a GRL (Grassroots Leader) in the Ulu Pandan Division and a member of the NParks, Nature Kakis community, participating in tree planting and therapeutic horticulture.  

My hobbies include playing badminton and volleyball, brisk walking, and reading a wide range of books from engineering to history and science. 
 
I also enjoy collecting DVDs, stamps, coins, MRT and telephone cards, miniature toys, and other memorabilia.
