![4 apps for nature lovers](/images/technews/four-apps-for-nature-lovers.png)


Since 2007, people around the world have been marking [Earth Hour](https://www.earthhour.org/) by turning off non-essential lights in the hope that darkened homes, billboards, and buildings will raise awareness about the environment. 

As this year’s Earth Hour approaches on March 23, why not take a further step by getting you beyond the concrete jungle we live in and appreciating what we’re trying to protect – the beauty of nature.

We have four apps that will enhance your outdoor experience and boost your knowledge about Singapore’s greenery. 



**4 Apps for the great outdoors!:**

### 1. Learn about the green giants around you with TreesSG

Singapore is a garden city replete with trees, shrubs, and all manners of plants throughout its urban landscape. And while trees may look very similar to the untrained eye, the trees of Singapore actually come from a bewildering variety of species and have different, unique characteristics. 

Explore the trees of Singapore by using this interactive [map](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg) of the island (yes, NParks and GovTech really did map over [half a million](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/the-inside-story-of-how-nparks-mapped-500000-trees-in-singapore-on-treessg) trees). You can click on any tree on the map to see its name, characteristics, and the benefits it provides. Curious about the trees around your home or in a particular area? You can use the search function to see trees in a chosen location or to look for specific species that you are interested in. 

What’s more, useful symbols also mark out special trees, such as those designated as heritage trees and those that are flowering. Users like yourself can also play a part in enriching the website as you can upload photos to share sightings of flowering trees and even tag notes of appreciation to your favourite tree. 

You can also follow the myriad of recommended [trails](https://beta.nparks.gov.sg/visit/activities/nature-walks-tours) that will let you discover local trees and biodiversity. For instance, the [Civic District tree trail](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/~/media/nparks-real-content/gardens-parks-and-nature/diy-walk/diy-walk-pdf-files/civic-district-tree-trail.pdf) introduces you to some of the oldest trees in Singapore while also revealing their place in the country’s history. 

As for those with young children below the age of three, you can check this [linked page](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement/familytrees) to look out for opportunities to commemorate your child’s birth by planting a tree. The tree will grow along with your little one, and wouldn’t it be cool to look back one day to see how far both of them have come?

### 2. See what lives near you with SGBioAtlas 

As a tropical island, Singapore is home to a treasure trove of biodiversity. SGBioAtlas relies on crowd sourcing to map the distribution of flora and fauna on the island. 

Under the [“sightings”](https://biome.nparks.gov.sg/Sightings/) tab, there are photos of kingfishers, snakes, butterflies, and even cockroaches that are geotagged to different locations. In the map view, you can also filter for the category (birds, arthropods, amphibians, etc) you want to see. 

And as always, you are welcome to make a submission, so if you see something intriguing on your outdoor adventures, be sure to snap a picture, upload it to SGBioAtlas app and enhance this biodiversity repository. And don’t worry if you don’t know the name of the critter you saw. The cataloguing can be done on your behalf after experts have had the time to look at your photo contribution. 

Learn about SGBioAtlas [here](https://biome.nparks.gov.sg/). 


### 3. Bring nature nearer with NParks Explore A Route

The NParks Explore A Route, or NEAR, app is another map platform. This one is however dedicated to park connectors and trails all over the island. 

Following the routes on the app will give you an interactive curated walking experience. For example, the 36 km Coast to Coast trail features augmented reality checkpoints where AR animals spring to live and share about the local flora and fauna. 

You can also be part of an active hiking community that creates its own trails, sharing them through the self-mapping feature “Phyll My Trail”. It even allows you to mark out gorgeous sights and interesting information that you spot along the way. 

If you can’t access the app, you can still access information on the park connector networks and trails on NParks’ [website.](https://pcn.nparks.gov.sg/aboutrecreationalconnectivity/) 
  

### 4. Be prepared for the weather with MyENV

Going out to experience nature means leaving the comfort of the indoors – and facing the elements. Whether you’re walking along the Rail Corridor, hiking up Bukit Timah Hill, or just picnicking at Coney Island, MyEnv will be a useful companion to download on your phone!

Most people know MyENV for providing accurate and up-to-date data on the weather, but of course, it’s more than that. The app also gives you information about dengue hot spots, air quality, water levels, floods, food hygiene, and where to recycle your waste. 

Download MyEnv [here.](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/initiatives/urban-living/myenv-app/)


### Embrace the great outdoors
Yes, there is a certain irony in using tech to encourage us to embrace the great outdoors. But hey, who said tech is just about staying in air con rooms and mindlessly looking at our devices? 

Ultimately, tech is simply a tool that we can apply to different situations and goals. And it’s definitely a worthy goal to get close to nature. 

After all, Earth Hour is just a symbolic gesture in raising awareness about the enormous task of sustainability. It’s up to us to appreciate the environmental richness we have on our sunny island and pass it on to the next generation. 

We can’t think of a better starting point for having a love for nature.
