How long has it been since you last travelled? The only right answer is that it’s been too long.  

Well, for everyone who’s sick of visiting the same few brunch places over and over again, here’s something different to try! We’ve taken URA’s already popular [Singapore City Gallery](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Singapore-City-Gallery) at the URA Centre and augmented it with new features to showcase what Smart Nation is all about. Welcome to the [Smart Nation CityScape!](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/community/showcases/cityscape)

Through a series of interactive stations and displays, we’ve summarised the best bits from Singapore’s digital transformation journey and Smart Nation initiatives. With a grand total of 72 initiatives from 38 organisations, you might even spot some familiar projects that you already know. 

Here are some of our favourite stations you’ll want to look out for. 
						
## Building a Better Home
 
URA’s Central Area Model of Singapore is already a crowd favourite. It features intricate models of structures such as the Singapore Flyer, Republic Plaza and Capital Tower. 

To add an interactive dimension, we incorporated Augmented Reality (AR) and tablets to let visitors zoom in on the different digital tools and services available in Singapore that enrich the lives of citizens. 

This exhibition showcases how our Smart Nation seeks to harness and apply digital technologies to improve lives and empower citizens to achieve their aspirations, bring communities closer together, and encourage businesses to innovate and grow.

## Build your own avatar 

Love choosing characters in MMORPGs? Then you will like *Technology Within Your Reach*. We haven’t exactly got wizards, warriors or clerics in this exhibition, but you will get to customise your own avatar based on nine ‘archetypes’. You’ll then be given a ‘cheat sheet’ of digital services relevant to your archetype!  

## Now you see me, now you don’t!

Now that you’ve completed your avatar, here’s the cool part – get teleported into a virtual Singapore (reminiscent of that Sims game we used to play) and see the avatar walk around its animated streets. 

In *Unlocking Invisible Benefits*, you’ll discover how tech is quietly working behind the scenes to make life better for all of us.  

## Change, change, change

You might not realise, but the Singapore we see today has changed a lot over the past 10 years. Part of the reason for Singapore’s success as a Smart Nation is its uncanny ability to constantly adapt to new challenges. 
Two exhibitions capture this zeitgeist.  

*Embracing Transformation* takes you on a trip down memory lane, with interesting artefacts (tear-out parking coupons, anyone?) that show how things were like in the old days. Of course, that was before technology took over to make things faster, safer, and more convenient for everyone. 

In *Working Together for Tomorrow*, visitors get a primer on the tech ecosystem here, as well as digitalisation programmes that attract talent, transform businesses, and grow Singapore. If you’re exploring a future career in tech, this is the exhibit for you. 

## A hidden message

At first glance, *You & Me* is a simple digital message board for one to express what a Smart Nation means to them. And for the most part, it is – you might also enjoy reading others’ thoughts and comments on how everyone has a role to play in building a Smart Nation. 

More tech savvy observers will, however, notice that there’s an Easter egg to be deciphered within the exhibit. 

Those who do will be rewarded with a hidden message...and, of course, bragging rights. 

## Come and visit!

Since CityScape is located in the heart of town, you could always pop by Maxwell Centre for a meal after. Or take a short walk to explore the historic Ann Siang Hill Park and Telok Ayer Green, which are a stone’s throw away. 

Fun family day out? Slightly geeky first date? Everyone is welcome. 

See you there!
