In a world that is increasingly digital, leaving anyone behind is not an option. This is particularly true in Singapore, where we have a rapidly ageing population. In 2023, nearly one-fifth of Singapore's population was elderly. 

But it's not just about age — vulnerable communities of all kinds need to be considered as technology becomes more deeply ingrained in daily life.
That’s why at GovTech, we believe that digital services are for everyone. This is why by 2030, we’re aiming to ensure that all high-traffic government websites are accessible to persons with disabilities.

As of 2023, we’re at 73% — up 10% from the previous year.

But beyond the stats, there’s a certain method to how we approach things. Singapore's strategy rests on three pillars. Let’s start with the first… 

## An Accretive and Agile Approach

Due to the dynamic nature of digital development, we adopt an accretive and agile approach when it comes to the development of our digital products. This means prioritising continuous improvement to meet the changing needs of all users in hopes of preventing a digital divide.

One such example is the Singpass app — since its launch in 2018, the app has undergone numerous enhancements to make it more user-friendly for everyone.

For instance, in 2020, we introduced the [Multi-User SMS 2FA](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/media-releases/2020-12-16-singpass-2fa){:target="_blank"}, allowing users who require assistance to transact online securely. Then, we further expanded the app's [language support in 2022](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/how-singpass-learnt-three-languages){:target="_blank"} to include more Mother Tongues, making it accessible to a wider audience. In addition, accessibility features like dark mode and screen-reader support were added to make app navigation seamless for visually impaired users.

## Investing in our people and their skills 

For an inclusive Singapore, we need to empower every citizen with digital skills. That’s what we believe anyway. 

Through programs like [Digital Skills for Life](https://www.imda.gov.sg/digitalforlife/digital-skills-for-life){:target="_blank"} and [Seniors Go Digital](https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/seniors-go-digital){:target="_blank"}, we aim to equip individuals of all ages and backgrounds with technology usage confidence and knowledge. 

These programmes may seem basic, but they are an important foundation for one to navigate the intricacies of the digital world. 

It’s never too late to learn!

## Tackling problems from multiple perspectives 

All organisations have blindspots, but we try to minimise ours by constantly learning and improving through the use of testing tools and engagement with citizen communities. 

One particular project we’re extremely proud of is [Purple A11y](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/design/purple-a11y/overview.html){:target="_blank"}, an open-source automated testing tool developed by our [A11y Team](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/design/purple-a11y/meet-the-team){:target="_blank"}. The tool is even listed internationally on the Digital Public Good Registry by the [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/digit.html){:target="_blank"}!

Since its launch in July 2023, it has fixed 6.4 million accessibility issues and scanned over 500,000 websites worldwide, with 57% being Singapore-based pages and 43% from everywhere else in the world. 

Purple A11y currently plays a key role in identifying and suggesting mitigating ways to resolve potential accessibility issues on government websites — think agencies like MOE, IRAS, and NEA! In addition, government agencies are also guided by the [Digital Service Standards (DSS)](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards/){:target="_blank"} when designing digital services. The idea is to make products that are accessible, inclusive, usable, and relevant. 

Last but not least, our [Tech Kaki community](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/tech-kaki-community/){:target="_blank"} allows citizens to actively participate in evaluating the accessibility of digital services, providing valuable feedback to us.

## It's all about the ecosystem

United we stand, divided we fall. Or so the saying goes.

We believe that collaboration with industry and community partners is essential for creating an ecosystem of accessible services.
Our annual [A11y Week](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/events/a11y-week-2024){:target="_blank"}, a digital inclusion learning festival for public officers, showcases the importance of partnerships in driving progress. 

This year's event features sharings by leading industry players like Apple, Microsoft, and Smart BFA, emphasising the theme "Progress over Perfection."

The inaugural Co-Creation Lab, launched at A11y Week 2024, will further foster collaboration between the government, industry, and end-users. This initiative aims to create a platform for ongoing dialogue and co-creation, ensuring that Singapore's digital services are truly accessible and inclusive for all.

## Inclusivity is in the Singaporean DNA

As countries around the world grapple with the digital divide, let’s do our best to stay together. Our National Pledge says that Singaporeans are one united people, regardless of race, language or religion.

Well, in the digital era, we’ll go one step further and add ability to that list.
