As 2021 draws to a close, we look back at how our tech solutions have helped you, our fellow citizens and residents of Singapore, live a little better and stay a little safer. 

Here’s a story that we all might be familiar with - a story of time and how we never seem to have enough of it. As we went about our daily lives in the past year, we hope the use of our tech helped give time back to spend with your loved ones and on things that matter most.

What an eventful year 2021 had been. The 2nd year under the pandemic, our fight against the evolving coronavirus continues, as the world adjusts to its ‘new normal' 
We at GovTech continued to harness the power of technology with the goal of making lives better in Singapore, even as some of our teams were at the 'frontline' of developing and enhancing products that help in our management of COVID-19. Here's a look back at some of the projects that we are most grateful for in 2021:
