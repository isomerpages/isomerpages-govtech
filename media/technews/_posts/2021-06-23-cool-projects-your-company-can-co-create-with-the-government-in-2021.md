Have a company with tech expertise? Always wanted to lend a hand in building the Smart Nation? Then throw your hat into the ring to compete for a slice of the pie as the government is spending up to $3.8 billion on info-communications technology (ICT) procurement in 2021, up 10 per cent from last year. 

What’s more, you don’t have to be a tech giant to partner the government to sustain the momentum generated by past years’ investments and to lock in the digitalisation gains brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 80 per cent of the procurement opportunities are open to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), a continuation of last year’s practice when SMEs were awarded 75 per cent of ICT contracts. 

Excited yet? There will be a LinkedIn Live chat held on 30 June 2021 to share details of the Government’s key digitalisation focuses and areas of projected spending.
