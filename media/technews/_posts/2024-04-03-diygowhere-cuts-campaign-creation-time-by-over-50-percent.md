![DIYGoWhere: Empowering users to build their own campaign](/images/technews/DIYGoWhere-article-banner.png)

By now, you’re probably familiar with GoWhere and its multiple campaigns, instantly recognisable by the URL [gowhere.gov.sg/](https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, GoWhere has offered easy access to services and information. Two classic pandemic-era examples were instrumental in informing Singaporeans where to get vaccinated (VaccineGoWhere), as well as where to pick up ART test kits (ARTGoWhere). 

But since then, the GoWhere team has been busy expanding the GoWhere suite of campaigns to help Singaporeans in aspects such as:

- Giving easy access to financial support
- Helping Singaporeans cope with the cost of living pressures
- Helping Singaporeans stay active and connected to their community
- Fostering resilience and preparedness

## Giving easy access to financial support

There are a lot of support schemes you can tap into, but you might not always be privy to them. And that’s precisely what [SupportGoWhere](https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} aims to solve.

Whether you're a caregiver looking to get [subsidies for mobility and assistive devices](https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/schemes/SMF/seniors-mobility-enabling-fund){:target="_blank"} for your loved ones with limited mobility, or parents [looking for temporary housing](https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/schemes/PPHS/parenthood-provisional-housing-scheme){:target="_blank"} whilst your BTO is being completed, there’s something for you.

## Helping Singaporeans support heartland merchants

For a couple of years now, Singapore introduced the CDC (Community Development Council) vouchers to help heartland merchants survive trying business environments. At the same time, the CDC vouchers are also a way to give Singaporeans a way to cope with cost of living pressures. 

To help Singaporeans support heartland merchants, the GoWhere team created [CDCVouchersGoWhere](https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/cdcvouchers){:target="_blank"} – allowing citizens to find out where they can spend their CDC vouchers easily.

## Helping Singaporeans stay active and connected to their community 

[HealthierSGEventsGoWhere](https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/hsgevents/){:target="_blank"} is a one-stop directory for community healthy lifestyle activities. These include yoga, brisk walking, HIIT, K-pop-inspired workouts and yes, good ol’ classic line dancing. 

## Fostering resilience and preparedness 

Last but not least, this year, the GoWhere team also supported the conduct of the inaugural Exercise SG Ready via [SGReadyGoWhere](https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/sgready/){:target="_blank"}. Held in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Total Defence, Exercise SG Ready aimed to increase Singapore’s readiness for crises and disruptions. Participating organisations across Singapore simulated disruptions to power, water, food supply, and digital connectivity as well as conducted fire evacuation drills during the two-week exercise period from 15 Feb to 29 Feb. 

With SGReadyGoWhere, Singaporeans could easily find out the dates, duration and locations of these disruptions during the exercise period. At the same time, Singaporeans can also use the SGReadyGoWhere to locate their nearest Civil Defence shelters in the event of a wartime emergency.

## But here’s the thing: GoWhere is resource-intensive  

While users might appreciate the helpfulness of GoWhere campaigns, they might not fully appreciate the amount of effort that goes into creating them. Behind the scenes, the GoWhere team deals with multiple parties to collate, coordinate, verify and publish all the information. 

In the past, here’s what creating a GoWhere website would look like:

The GoWhere team has to liaise with both business users from the public service, and the DCube team (Digital, Design, Development), effectively functioning as the bridge between both parties.

This old process is time-consuming and also requires a lot of manpower. Getting a GoWhere site up takes an average of about 4 days, and servicing takes an average of 3 days. Each time, six people are involved: a Delivery Manager, a Designer, an Engineer and three Translators.

Given the demand for GoWhere websites, this can quickly become overwhelming.

## DIYGoWhere – empowering users to build their own GoWhere campaign 

In response, the GoWhere team has launched DIYGoWhere, a ground-up initiative that enables business users to self-update existing GoWhere sites and eventually request to self-spin up new GoWhere sites.

Features include a campaign site builder, content management with approval flow, translation request and fulfilment tracker, as well as user management.

To put it simply, DIYGoWhere promises:

- More control for business owners, allowing them to update GoWhere campaign sites anytime.
- Increased speed to market of GoWhere campaigns.
- Reduced resource involvement & coordination work from all parties.

It is expected that DIYGoWhere will reduce update and launch times to less than a day, with no manpower requirements from the GoWhere team. 

## Unlocking the possibilities

From collecting CDC vouchers to helping out with Total Defence, the [GoWhere.gov.sg](https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} suite of products has helped simplify various aspects of life for Singaporeans. With the implementation of DIYGoWhere, we’re excited to see what else can be created. 

Who knows what a more decentralised, user-driven approach will bring? For now, only the future knows.
