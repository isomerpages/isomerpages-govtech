The Digital Services Awards, an annual event dedicated to recognising exceptional digital service standards, will be expanding beyond government agencies to feature categories solely for the industry sector, encouraging broader participation and acknowledging the valuable contributions of citizens and private organisations.

This year will be the Awards’ third edition and see the introduction of a new award category, "Outstanding Citizen Contributor", which will recognise citizens who have actively participated in and contributed to improving government digital services. Additionally, the categories of "Best Usability" and "Most Popular Informational Website" will be open to industry nominations for the first time, with a public and private sector winner for each of the categories.

While a significant portion of the awards focuses on technical excellence, powered by the Whole-of-government Application Analytics (WOGAA), other categories acknowledge user experience, visual appeal, and qualitative aspects. This balanced approach celebrates holistic achievements.

Further details of each award category are available at the end of this article.

*Important dates to take note of!*

As for government agencies, the government nomination form will be sent via GovTech DigitalGov by the first half of June. 

To ensure fairness and appropriate representation, government agencies will be grouped based on their digital maturity and resources owned, resulting in three size classifications: Large, Medium, and Small, determined by the number of Informational Websies  sites owned.


## Evaluation timeline and criteria
The evaluation process consists of three tiers, with evaluation conducted by both experts and citizen judges:
### Tier 1: Establishing the Top 10 - Pre-screening Evaluation (Aug-Sep 2023)

After the nomination period ends, the nominated Informational Websites will undergo pre-screening based on GovTech's [Digital Services Standards.](https://www.tech.gov.sg/files/digital-transformation/DSS%20for%20Public%202020.pdf) The top 10 nominees fulfilling the baseline standards of intuitivity, usability, accessibility, and inclusivity will proceed to the next round and automatically become nominees for the Most Popular Informational Website award. 

The top 10 nominees will be revealed in September 2023 on the Digital Services Awards website.

### Tier 2: Establishing the Top 3 - Judges Evaluation (Sep-Oct 2023)

A panel of judges will evaluate the top 10 nominees based on Nielsen Norman's Group 10 Usability Heuristics for [User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), and their own expert domain knowledge. The top three nominees with the best scores will advance to the final round.

### Tier 3: Establishing the Final Winner - Citizen Evaluation (Oct-Nov 2023)

One hundred citizen evaluators, including Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), will assess the top three nominees using the [System Usability Scale (SUS)](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/system-usability-scale/). The nominee with the highest combined score from the judges and citizen evaluation will win.
