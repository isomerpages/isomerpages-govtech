Any new year resolutions that revolve around learning or upgrading your skills? Today’s article is just for you!

As a tech hub, Singapore is host to the regional headquarters of several global tech companies. The city state is also home to a vibrant startup scene that has produced its share of unicorns. Other industries, from financial institutions to fast moving consumer goods, have also been building up their tech workforce. 

Little wonder then that tech skills continue to be in demand. If you’ve ever considered picking up these skills and becoming a tech professional, there are a myriad of resources to turn to both online and in the classroom. 

But as the saying goes, the best things in life are free. So here, we highlight a few options that will not only give you an introduction to the world of tech, but also won’t cost you money. 

## AI Singapore Student Outreach Programme

This [scheme](https://learn.aisingapore.org/student-outreach-programme/) by AI Singapore was launched in July 2022 to promote AI literacy and proficiency among students. 

The programme, which is open to students from secondary school to university, consists of three levels and will equip participants with programming skills and practical experience in AI projects. Completion of each level will earn students an industry-recognised certificate and those who finish level three will receive the Google professional machine learning engineer certificate. 

Polytechnic and university students who attain level three will also get an internship opportunity to work with AI Singapore’s AI engineers and AI apprentices on real-world projects.

Applications are open all year round for the first two levels, while level three accepts applications in January and August every year. 

## SkillsFuture@NS Learning eXperience Platform

While many full time national servicemen (NSFs) today are proud to be contributing to the military and civil defence of our country, there is still the concern of lagging behind in their studies and careers due to the two years in uniform. 
To address this, the [SkillsFuture@NS Learning eXperience Platform](https://www.mindef.gov.sg/web/portal/mindef/news-and-events/latest-releases/article-detail/2022/September/21sep22_fs) was launched in November 2022, giving NSFs free unlimited access to over 75,000 online courses in about 135 categories. 

Skills that they can pick up include python programming, machine learning, management training, and digital photography. 

Some of the courses can also be used for credit exemptions at institutes of higher learning like polytechnics and universities.

## Coursera 

Coursera, a pioneer in massive open online courses, offers many of its courses for free. Best of all, some are from world renowned universities.

You can learn about [machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and [game theory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1) from Stanford University, [COVID-19 contact tracing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/covid-19-contact-tracing?edocomorp=covid-19-contact-tracing) from Johns Hopkins University or the [disease](https://www.coursera.org/learn/covid-19) in general from Imperial College London, [microeconomics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/microeconomics-part2) from the University of Pennsylvania, and the [principles of computer programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java) from Princeton University.

Yes, you take classes from these prestigious educational institutions from the comfort of your home and it won’t cost you a cent! 

## General Assembly

General Assembly is known for running bootcamps for mid-career switchers who aspire to a new path in tech as software engineers, data scientists, and product managers. 

While these bootcamps usually involve monetary commitment and a few months of effort, they also run free, short courses for those who are curious about tech. 

These include introduction courses to [python coding](https://generalassemb.ly/education/intro-to-python-free-online-livestream/online), [data analytics](https://generalassemb.ly/education/intro-to-data-analytics-livestream), [UX design](https://generalassemb.ly/education/free-intro-to-ux-design-class-online/online/), and [digital marketing](https://generalassemb.ly/education/free-intro-to-digital-marketing-class-online/online/). There are also classes on specific tools that you can put to use immediately like Excel and Google Analytics. 

You can even access resources on general skills such as a class on [public speaking.](https://generalassemb.ly/education/intro-to-public-speaking-free-online-livestream/online)

## Explore and expand your knowledge

It can be daunting to consider a career in tech, whether you’re thinking of choosing a tech major when entering a tertiary institute or thinking of switching to a tech career. 

The great thing about these free resources is that it gives you a chance to dip your toes in the tech pool to see if you can build up sustained interest and momentum to continue pursuing something more long term in tech. 

All it takes is some time commitment and an open mind to really give it a go and see if it’s your cup of tea. 

Who knows, that free course you dabble with today may well lead to a rewarding career in tech in the future.
