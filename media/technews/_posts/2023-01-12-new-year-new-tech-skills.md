Any new year resolutions that revolve around learning or upgrading your skills? Today’s article is just for you!

As a tech hub, Singapore is host to the regional headquarters of several global tech companies. The city state is also home to a vibrant startup scene that has produced its share of unicorns. Other industries, from financial institutions to fast moving consumer goods, have also been building up their tech workforce. 

Little wonder then that tech skills continue to be in demand. If you’ve ever considered picking up these skills and becoming a tech professional, there are a myriad of resources to turn to both online and in the classroom. 

But as the saying goes, the best things in life are free. So here, we highlight a few options that will not only give you an introduction to the world of tech, but also won’t cost you money. 

## AI Singapore Student Outreach Programme
This [scheme](https://learn.aisingapore.org/student-outreach-programme/) by AI Singapore was launched in July 2022 to promote AI literacy and proficiency among students. 

The programme, which is open to students from secondary school to university, consists of three levels and will equip participants with programming skills and practical experience in AI projects. Completion of each level will earn students an industry-recognised certificate and those who finish level three will receive the Google professional machine learning engineer certificate. 

Polytechnic and university students who attain level three will also get an internship opportunity to work with AI Singapore’s AI engineers and AI apprentices on real-world projects.

Applications are open all year round for the first two levels, while level three accepts applications in January and August every year. 

## SkillsFuture@NS Learning eXperience Platform
