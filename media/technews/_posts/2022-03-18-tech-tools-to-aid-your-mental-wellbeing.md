Cast your minds back, if you will, to the first months of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic was flaring up across the world. How many of us would have thought then that the situation would persist for a year, let alone two? 

Yet here we are, well into 2022, still masked, still social distancing and still dealing with new variants of COVID. 

If you’re feeling down, know that you’re not alone in this [languishing](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html). Here are some tech tools that can help keep the blues at bay and uplift your mental wellbeing.

## Unplug yourself

The constant barrage of technology can get overwhelming. And yes, it’s kinda ironic to be using tech to curb tech, but if it works, why not? 

You can start off by silencing the incessation stream of notifications coming to your smartphone. Apple users can use the [Do Not Disturb](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT204321) mode, which can be scheduled to kick in during the times you want to take a break from the world. Worried that you might miss an important call in case of emergency? You can still allow calls from certain contacts to come through or let the second call through if someone calls you twice within three minutes. 

If you’re a social media addict, consider setting a [daily reminder](https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-break) within the Instagram app to notify you when you’ve hit your self-imposed time limit on scrolling endless photos and videos. 

For those who like to fall asleep to music, Spotify’s [sleep timer](https://www.businessinsider.com/does-spotify-have-a-sleep-timer) feature will turn off the app after a fixed time set by you. That way, you can drift off to your favourite tunes or set some soothing ambient sounds to help you catch some sleep without worrying about your phone battery draining overnight. 

Speaking of sleep, it’s not just the quantity but also the quality that matters. We all know how frustrating it is to toss and turn, drift in and out of sleep and then get out of bed 10 hours later but none the better rested. Sleep apps like SleepScore and Sleep Cycle help you track your sleep patterns, set sleep goals, and provide advice on steps to take to get a better night’s rest. 

## Meditation 

We’ve all seen photos and videos of people meditating. That perfect, straight backed posture with legs crossed. The look of calm and focus at the same time. An ethereal smile across the face. 

If you’ve ever wanted to try meditation but don’t know where to start, there are apps that can guide you. [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/how-it-works) provides mindfulness exercises to familiarise you with meditation concepts, helping to reduce stress and improve focus.

Headspace also has a Netflix [show](https://www.netflix.com/sg/title/81328827) on sleep, addressing misconceptions, giving tips on rest, and providing wind down techniques. 

## E-therapy

The pandemic has accelerated adoption of online meetings across industries and mental health support is no exception. Digital tools have made such support more accessible and because of this, more are willing to start dealing with mental-health challenges. The good news is that Cognitive-behavioral therapy over video and apps with programmes for treating depression and anxiety have both been reported to reduce symptoms. 

For those who want to find out more, you can try [Mindline](https://www.mindline.sg), a collaboration among several government agencies to provide a [one stop shop](https://govinsider.asia/future-of-work/robert-morris-moht-how-singapore-built-mental-health-tech-during-covid-19/) for mental health support from the privacy of your home.

## Health monitoring through wearables

Smartwatches are becoming almost as common as smartphones. But beyond being techy and cool, they also provide several benefits like tracking heart rate, skin temperature, and electrodermal activity to assess well-being. 

Many people are already using their smartwatches together with [LumiHealth](https://www.lumihealth.sg/), a personalised health programme designed by Singapore Health Promotion Board in collaboration with Apple. 

But did you know LumiHeatlth is not just for physical but also mental wellbeing? The programme features mental wellbeing challenges including tips for stress management and support tools. This includes a mindfulness app that enables users to engage in breathing exercises while tracking their heart rate.  

## Take a breath for the long haul

This battle with the virus has turned out to be a marathon rather than a sprint. So it’s all the more important not to be burnt out. 

Periodic check-ins with yourself and others around you will ensure we are able to keep running for the long haul. Here’s to 2022 being the year of transforming from languishing to flourishing!
