### **Beware of scam letter bearing GovTech’s logo and forged signatures**

The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) has received reports of scam letters sent to suppliers via fax. These scam letters, seeking advertising support for a publication, used GovTech’s logo without authorisation and borne the forged signatures of the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group’s Permanent Secretary, Mr Ng Chee Khern, and GovTech’s Chief Executive, Mr Kok Ping Soon. These letters were not sent out by GovTech. Please see pictures of the scam letter below.
