Industry Briefing has been rebranded as Industry Engagement (IE) to better reflect its new ambition to foster deeper ties and valuable collaborations with the industry. 

IE is where GovTech gathers with our industry partners for a meaningful two-way dialogue-sharing from industry partners about their expertise, and how this might address changing citizens’ and businesses' needs.

More details on the announcements are found in the [media release](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/media-releases/2024-05-14-government-ict-procurement-opportunities-in-fy24){:target="_blank"}.
